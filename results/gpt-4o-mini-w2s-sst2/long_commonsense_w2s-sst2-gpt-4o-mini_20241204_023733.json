My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.  Very cute. Good girl.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I let my parents forget my 21st birthday? | Ever since I started my new job, I haven\u2019t been talking to my parents much. I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends. As such most years for my birthday I\u2019ve just done things with my family. Mostly stuff at home with cake, maybe a movie, sometimes going out to eat etc. \n\nMy birthday is on a Monday this year so not great lol. I figured we could do something on the Saturday or Sunday before though. When I went to my mom to discuss what I might want to do, maybe go to the movies and go out for dinner,she brushed me off a bit. \u201cYeah I guess we can do that.\u201d \u201cWell we\u2019ll have to see - your  dad might want to do something else that day.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the family would like eating at that place.\u201d It just felt cold and like we weren\u2019t even talking about a birthday. I know it\u2019s stupid  to care so much about birthdays as an adult but like.... is it really bad to want to celebrate a bit when I work hard all week? My parents are retired and there\u2019s nothing majorly stressful at home going on rn so I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re acting this way. \n\nWIBTA if I don\u2019t remind my mom to talk to my dad or discuss this anymore and just let them forget about my birthday and doing anything? My mom forgot my 18th birthday a few years ago until about noon that day and she felt awful, but this time I feel like she wouldn\u2019t even really care.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I reported a subreddit for AP students to the CollegeBoard Office of Testing Integrity since they're discussing answers on the test during the 48 hour limit period? | So I took an AP exam this week (I will keep it ambiguous), and they tell us that we are not allowed to discuss the test material for 48 hours after the test, and never if it's not published to the CollegeBoard site.\n\nI see people on a certain subreddit who are discussing the test material, and my OCD is wanting me to report them.

I primarily teach the junior classes (ages 4-10). Some of our kids have special needs (like ADHD, epilepsy, autism, etc) and we work with these kids to help them all succeed. \n\nMy cousin\u2019s daughter Hanna is 8. Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.) I\u2019m not a qualified mental health professional, and I don\u2019t want to do an armchair diagnosis\nc.) it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my business, as I am not Hanna\u2019s parent\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the judgement and advice! I\u2019m definitely going to talk to my cousin about Hanna. As many commenters suggested, I\u2019m not even going to mention the word \u201cautism\u201d when I talk to Hanna\u2019s parents. I\u2019ll bring up the idea of counseling for Hanna to become more socially adjusted. Hopefully a qualified professional will help with Hanna\u2019s situation.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for embarrassing my son? | It was my sons 13th birthday a while ago, I had him the day after.\n\nThe plan was my ex, Tiff, threw a party and I had him the next day.\n\nI told son he could have 6 friends over.\n\nSon arrives at mine with bags of snacks and money for pizza, at his favourite place.\n\nThere was like \u00a350 worth of snacks, maybe more and money for  his favourite pizza place, which is like \u00a313 for a small pizza each, it's a small business so it's understandable.\n\nI have two daughters, 7 and 9.\n\nHe refused to share his snacks with them and refused to share his pizza, claiming because his mum sent it and it was his day he didnt have to.\n\nI made him share and we got from pizza hut instead (I sent the spare money back with him)\n\nHe is now refusing to talk to me and his mother tells me she can \"*understand both sides*\" but still tells me I was an asshole in the situation, she says she didnt send food for his siblings.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA if I yelled at my kid for refusing to go to a sleepover? | My close friend (we'll call her S) asked if her daughter (we'll call her M), who doesn't go out that often, could have a sleepover with my teenage daughter (we'll call her J), who also doesn't go out that often. Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying. So AITA for trying to get my kid to have more friends?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting friends of my friends stay at my moms' place? | Usual disclaimer, I'm on mobile so sorry about the formating and english not my first language.\n\nFor a little background, in my hometown, there is a fairly famous four day festival that I go to every year with the same friend group from this town. But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore.

She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships.

Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too.

I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion.

We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability.

Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me.

We spent the day exploring and learning about different animals, and it was a wonderful experience for all of us. However, when we got to the lion exhibit, I noticed that the lions were not in their enclosure. I asked a zookeeper where they were, and they informed me that they were being treated for health issues. I was disappointed, but I understood that the animals' health comes first.\n\nAs we continued our visit, I overheard a group of parents complaining about the lions not being there. They were upset that they had paid for tickets and didn't get to see the lions. I tried to explain to them that the zoo is not just about seeing the lions, but about educating our children about wildlife and conservation. I felt like they were being unreasonable.\n\nI ended up getting into a heated discussion with them, and I raised my voice, telling them that they were being selfish and not thinking about the animals' well-being. I felt embarrassed for my children and for myself. I later apologized to my kids for the scene, but I still believe that I was right to defend the zoo's decision to prioritize the animals' health.\n\n**Verdict: not wrong**\"",

I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends. As such most years for my birthday I\u2019ve just done things with my family. Mostly stuff at home with cake, maybe a movie, sometimes going out to eat etc. \n\nMy birthday is on a Monday this year so not great lol. I figured we could do something on the Saturday or Sunday before though. When I went to my mom to discuss what I might want to do, maybe go to the movies and go out for dinner,she brushed me off a bit. \u201cYeah I guess we can do that.\u201d \u201cWell we\u2019ll have to see - your  dad might want to do something else that day.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the family would like eating at that place.\u201d It just felt cold and like we weren\u2019t even talking about a birthday. I know it\u2019s stupid  to care so much about birthdays as an adult but like.... is it really bad to want to celebrate a bit when I work hard all week?

I primarily teach the junior classes (ages 4-10). Some of our kids have special needs (like ADHD, epilepsy, autism, etc) and we work with these kids to help them all succeed. \n\nMy cousin\u2019s daughter Hanna is 8. Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.) I\u2019m not a qualified mental health professional, and I don\u2019t want to do an armchair diagnosis\nc.) it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my business, as I am not Hanna\u2019s parent\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the judgement and advice! I\u2019m definitely going to talk to my cousin about Hanna. As many commenters suggested, I\u2019m not even going to mention the word \u201cautism\u201d when I talk to Hanna\u2019s parents.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter.

I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion.

We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day.

We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here.

But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability.

I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

I primarily teach the junior classes (ages 4-10). Some of our kids have special needs (like ADHD, epilepsy, autism, etc) and we work with these kids to help them all succeed. \n\nMy cousin\u2019s daughter Hanna is 8. Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.)

I\u2019m definitely going to talk to my cousin about Hanna. As many commenters suggested, I\u2019m not even going to mention the word \u201cautism\u201d when I talk to Hanna\u2019s parents.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability.

That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter.

Multiple times she has invited her friends over without telling us, even though we have a groupchat. It's always sudden, and her friends leave extremely late (one time her friends decided to leave at 1:30 am on a Thursday). Since there's pretty much no space in our room, if A invites 4 people, they sit around on our beds, which is annoying. We tried talking to her that this shouldn't be happening, but she acts really selfish and disregards our interests.\n\nNow imagine this. It's Monday. Me and the other 19 year old roommate (let's call her S) leave in the morning, while A decides to sleep in.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.  Very cute. Good girl.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I let my parents forget my 21st birthday? | Ever since I started my new job, I haven\u2019t been talking to my parents much.

I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival.

Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too.

I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying. So AITA for trying to get my kid to have more friends?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting friends of my friends stay at my moms' place? | Usual disclaimer, I'm on mobile so sorry about the formating and english not my first language.\n\nFor a little background, in my hometown, there is a fairly famous four day festival that I go to every year with the same friend group from this town. But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore. Especially after he promised me free drinks on saturday at the bar he works at. \ud83d\ude0a\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for demanding my gf, who has never lived on her own, to live on her own first before I move in with her? | context.\n\ngf and I have been going at it for almost a year, and the idea of moving in together came up. but she has never lived on her own, and she doesn't understand concepts like 'first and last month rent is due at signing'.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.  Very cute. Good girl.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I let my parents forget my 21st birthday? | Ever since I started my new job, I haven\u2019t been talking to my parents much. I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends. As such most years for my birthday I\u2019ve just done things with my family. Mostly stuff at home with cake, maybe a movie, sometimes going out to eat etc. \n\nMy birthday is on a Monday this year so not great lol. I figured we could do something on the Saturday or Sunday before though. When I went to my mom to discuss what I might want to do, maybe go to the movies and go out for dinner,she brushed me off a bit. \u201cYeah I guess we can do that.\u201d \u201cWell we\u2019ll have to see - your  dad might want to do something else that day.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the family would like eating at that place.\u201d It just felt cold and like we weren\u2019t even talking about a birthday. I know it\u2019s stupid  to care so much about birthdays as an adult but like.... is it really bad to want to celebrate a bit when I work hard all week? My parents are retired and there\u2019s nothing majorly stressful at home going on rn so I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re acting this way. \n\nWIBTA if I don\u2019t remind my mom to talk to my dad or discuss this anymore and just let them forget about my birthday and doing anything?

Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.)

Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me.

They asked if there were any health or private issues going on and if so they could maybe give me longer to submit the work. \n\nI have to add, recently one of my friends has been diagnosed with depression and she has been put on Prozac for it- as a result she has been given extensions for all of her work. \n\nIn a moment of panic I said I too had been diagnosed as depressed in the hope I could also get an extension. I am planning on going to the docs this week to lie and get a letter from him to confirm I am depressed. I told my friends this and they now won\u2019t speak to me and think I am an asshole- but I don\u2019t see the issue. No one else is getting hurt it\u2019s just a small lie? \n\nTLDR: lying about being depressed to get an extension on college work",

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.  Very cute. Good girl.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I let my parents forget my 21st birthday? | Ever since I started my new job, I haven\u2019t been talking to my parents much. I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends. As such most years for my birthday I\u2019ve just done things with my family. Mostly stuff at home with cake, maybe a movie, sometimes going out to eat etc. \n\nMy birthday is on a Monday this year so not great lol.

Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying. So AITA for trying to get my kid to have more friends?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting friends of my friends stay at my moms' place? | Usual disclaimer, I'm on mobile so sorry about the formating and english not my first language.\n\nFor a little background, in my hometown, there is a fairly famous four day festival that I go to every year with the same friend group from this town. But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore. Especially after he promised me free drinks on saturday at the bar he works at. \ud83d\ude0a\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for demanding my gf, who has never lived on her own, to live on her own first before I move in with her? | context.\n\ngf and I have been going at it for almost a year, and the idea of moving in together came up. but she has never lived on her own, and she doesn't understand concepts like 'first and last month rent is due at signing'. AITA for then demanding she learn to live on her own first before I move in with her?\n\nEdit: hello everyone, I\u2019d like to thank you all for judging me on how much of an asshole I\u2019ve been, I talked to my gf about how I can\u2019t afford to take care of her me and rent and emergency contingencies for the next 6 months, and she said she will save up a substantial amount of money before we move in together and she said she\u2019ll help me pay my student loans as well so I feel really good about the resolution of this fight I had.

Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.)

I\u2019m definitely going to talk to my cousin about Hanna. As many commenters suggested, I\u2019m not even going to mention the word \u201cautism\u201d when I talk to Hanna\u2019s parents.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved.

No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships.

She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here.

No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later.

She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends.

Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.  Very cute. Good girl.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I let my parents forget my 21st birthday? | Ever since I started my new job, I haven\u2019t been talking to my parents much. I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends. As such most years for my birthday I\u2019ve just done things with my family. Mostly stuff at home with cake, maybe a movie, sometimes going out to eat etc. \n\nMy birthday is on a Monday this year so not great lol. I figured we could do something on the Saturday or Sunday before though. When I went to my mom to discuss what I might want to do, maybe go to the movies and go out for dinner,she brushed me off a bit. \u201cYeah I guess we can do that.\u201d \u201cWell we\u2019ll have to see - your  dad might want to do something else that day.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the family would like eating at that place.\u201d It just felt cold and like we weren\u2019t even talking about a birthday.

Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse.

I\u2019m definitely going to talk to my cousin about Hanna. As many commenters suggested, I\u2019m not even going to mention the word \u201cautism\u201d when I talk to Hanna\u2019s parents. I\u2019ll bring up the idea of counseling for Hanna to become more socially adjusted. Hopefully a qualified professional will help with Hanna\u2019s situation.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for embarrassing my son? | It was my sons 13th birthday a while ago, I had him the day after.\n\nThe plan was my ex, Tiff, threw a party and I had him the next day.\n\nI told son he could have 6 friends over.\n\nSon arrives at mine with bags of snacks and money for pizza, at his favourite place.\n\nThere was like \u00a350 worth of snacks, maybe more and money for  his favourite pizza place, which is like \u00a313 for a small pizza each, it's a small business so it's understandable.\n\nI have two daughters, 7 and 9.\n\nHe refused to share his snacks with them and refused to share his pizza, claiming because his mum sent it and it was his day he didnt have to.\n\nI made him share and we got from pizza hut instead (I sent the spare money back with him)\n\nHe is now refusing to talk to me and his mother tells me she can \"*understand both sides*\" but still tells me I was an asshole in the situation, she says she didnt send food for his siblings.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA if I yelled at my kid for refusing to go to a sleepover? | My close friend (we'll call her S) asked if her daughter (we'll call her M), who doesn't go out that often, could have a sleepover with my teenage daughter (we'll call her J), who also doesn't go out that often. Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying. So AITA for trying to get my kid to have more friends?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting friends of my friends stay at my moms' place? | Usual disclaimer, I'm on mobile so sorry about the formating and english not my first language.\n\nFor a little background, in my hometown, there is a fairly famous four day festival that I go to every year with the same friend group from this town. But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore. Especially after he promised me free drinks on saturday at the bar he works at. \ud83d\ude0a\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for demanding my gf, who has never lived on her own, to live on her own first before I move in with her? | context.\n\ngf and I have been going at it for almost a year, and the idea of moving in together came up. but she has never lived on her own, and she doesn't understand concepts like 'first and last month rent is due at signing'. AITA for then demanding she learn to live on her own first before I move in with her?\n\nEdit: hello everyone, I\u2019d like to thank you all for judging me on how much of an asshole I\u2019ve been, I talked to my gf about how I can\u2019t afford to take care of her me and rent and emergency contingencies for the next 6 months, and she said she will save up a substantial amount of money before we move in together and she said she\u2019ll help me pay my student loans as well so I feel really good about the resolution of this fight I had.

No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.  Very cute. Good girl.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I let my parents forget my 21st birthday? | Ever since I started my new job, I haven\u2019t been talking to my parents much. I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends. As such most years for my birthday I\u2019ve just done things with my family. Mostly stuff at home with cake, maybe a movie, sometimes going out to eat etc. \n\nMy birthday is on a Monday this year so not great lol. I figured we could do something on the Saturday or Sunday before though. When I went to my mom to discuss what I might want to do, maybe go to the movies and go out for dinner,she brushed me off a bit. \u201cYeah I guess we can do that.\u201d \u201cWell we\u2019ll have to see - your  dad might want to do something else that day.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the family would like eating at that place.\u201d It just felt cold and like we weren\u2019t even talking about a birthday. I know it\u2019s stupid  to care so much about birthdays as an adult but like.... is it really bad to want to celebrate a bit when I work hard all week? My parents are retired and there\u2019s nothing majorly stressful at home going on rn so I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re acting this way. \n\nWIBTA if I don\u2019t remind my mom to talk to my dad or discuss this anymore and just let them forget about my birthday and doing anything? My mom forgot my 18th birthday a few years ago until about noon that day and she felt awful, but this time I feel like she wouldn\u2019t even really care.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I reported a subreddit for AP students to the CollegeBoard Office of Testing Integrity since they're discussing answers on the test during the 48 hour limit period? | So I took an AP exam this week (I will keep it ambiguous), and they tell us that we are not allowed to discuss the test material for 48 hours after the test, and never if it's not published to the CollegeBoard site.\n\nI see people on a certain subreddit who are discussing the test material, and my OCD is wanting me to report them. But I'm not sure if I should and if they'd be able to see who it is.\n\nWIBTA or no.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I tell my cousin that I think her daughter needs therapy? | Preface: I\u2019m 20, but I have worked as a basketball coach since I was 15. I primarily teach the junior classes (ages 4-10). Some of our kids have special needs (like ADHD, epilepsy, autism, etc) and we work with these kids to help them all succeed. \n\nMy cousin\u2019s daughter Hanna is 8. Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.) I\u2019m not a qualified mental health professional, and I don\u2019t want to do an armchair diagnosis\nc.) it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my business, as I am not Hanna\u2019s parent\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the judgement and advice!

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts.

But to make a long story short I felt bad about making him take the dog back so I told him, he could keep it if he agreed to some basic rules. 1: I don't want the dog sitting on my furniture.(I own 90% of the furniture) 2: If he breaks or ruins anything you will replace it, not cover it up, not try to fix it, Replace it. 3: You will be the only person taking care of this dog, I will do absolutely nothing. 4: He is not allowed in my bedroom or attached Bathroom. 5: You do the vacuuming(Having had dogs most of my life until now, I know how much more vacuuming will have to be done with a dog around)\n\nWell we are now 3 months later and John is not enjoying this new arrangement, he calls me to please feed his dog, I say no. He calls me to please walk his dog because he is working late, No Sir. The dog decided to rip a hole in my couch, well that was an expensive one, wasn't it John? Will you do the vacuuming just once? No John I won't. Hey can you look after my dog I really want to go out tonight? No John, No I can't.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends.

I primarily teach the junior classes (ages 4-10). Some of our kids have special needs (like ADHD, epilepsy, autism, etc) and we work with these kids to help them all succeed. \n\nMy cousin\u2019s daughter Hanna is 8. Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.)

I\u2019m definitely going to talk to my cousin about Hanna. As many commenters suggested, I\u2019m not even going to mention the word \u201cautism\u201d when I talk to Hanna\u2019s parents.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying. So AITA for trying to get my kid to have more friends?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting friends of my friends stay at my moms' place? | Usual disclaimer, I'm on mobile so sorry about the formating and english not my first language.\n\nFor a little background, in my hometown, there is a fairly famous four day festival that I go to every year with the same friend group from this town. But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up.

We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability.

That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up.

I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends.

Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved.

No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships.

Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too.

I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends.

Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me.

No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self.

Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

It didn\u2019t smell but did look so gross and I wasn\u2019t expecting it on a well groomed woman like her. So I guess I gave an expression that was funny when I saw it, and later that night she heard me and some others talking about how disgusting she is. She was so upset she left the party with my son who\u2019s now furious and demanding I apologize to her or they\u2019re not coming back. Am I the asshole here in this situation? I feel like she\u2019s overreacting to nothing really, but everyone\u2019s getting mad at me.",

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends.

Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.)

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore. Especially after he promised me free drinks on saturday at the bar he works at. \ud83d\ude0a\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for demanding my gf, who has never lived on her own, to live on her own first before I move in with her? | context.\n\ngf and I have been going at it for almost a year, and the idea of moving in together came up. but she has never lived on her own, and she doesn't understand concepts like 'first and last month rent is due at signing'.

We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability.

That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too.

We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability.

Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too.

I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends. As such most years for my birthday I\u2019ve just done things with my family. Mostly stuff at home with cake, maybe a movie, sometimes going out to eat etc. \n\nMy birthday is on a Monday this year so not great lol. I figured we could do something on the Saturday or Sunday before though. When I went to my mom to discuss what I might want to do, maybe go to the movies and go out for dinner,she brushed me off a bit. \u201cYeah I guess we can do that.\u201d \u201cWell we\u2019ll have to see - your  dad might want to do something else that day.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the family would like eating at that place.\u201d It just felt cold and like we weren\u2019t even talking about a birthday. I know it\u2019s stupid  to care so much about birthdays as an adult but like.... is it really bad to want to celebrate a bit when I work hard all week?

Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.)

We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day.

I primarily teach the junior classes (ages 4-10). Some of our kids have special needs (like ADHD, epilepsy, autism, etc) and we work with these kids to help them all succeed. \n\nMy cousin\u2019s daughter Hanna is 8. Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.)

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here.

No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships.

We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later.

She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me.

I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends. As such most years for my birthday I\u2019ve just done things with my family. Mostly stuff at home with cake, maybe a movie, sometimes going out to eat etc. \n\nMy birthday is on a Monday this year so not great lol. I figured we could do something on the Saturday or Sunday before though.

I primarily teach the junior classes (ages 4-10). Some of our kids have special needs (like ADHD, epilepsy, autism, etc) and we work with these kids to help them all succeed. \n\nMy cousin\u2019s daughter Hanna is 8. Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.) I\u2019m not a qualified mental health professional, and I don\u2019t want to do an armchair diagnosis\nc.) it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my business, as I am not Hanna\u2019s parent\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the judgement and advice! I\u2019m definitely going to talk to my cousin about Hanna. As many commenters suggested, I\u2019m not even going to mention the word \u201cautism\u201d when I talk to Hanna\u2019s parents. I\u2019ll bring up the idea of counseling for Hanna to become more socially adjusted. Hopefully a qualified professional will help with Hanna\u2019s situation.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for embarrassing my son? | It was my sons 13th birthday a while ago, I had him the day after.\n\nThe plan was my ex, Tiff, threw a party and I had him the next day.\n\nI told son he could have 6 friends over.\n\nSon arrives at mine with bags of snacks and money for pizza, at his favourite place.\n\nThere was like \u00a350 worth of snacks, maybe more and money for  his favourite pizza place, which is like \u00a313 for a small pizza each, it's a small business so it's understandable.\n\nI have two daughters, 7 and 9.\n\nHe refused to share his snacks with them and refused to share his pizza, claiming because his mum sent it and it was his day he didnt have to.\n\nI made him share and we got from pizza hut instead (I sent the spare money back with him)\n\nHe is now refusing to talk to me and his mother tells me she can \"*understand both sides*\" but still tells me I was an asshole in the situation, she says she didnt send food for his siblings.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA if I yelled at my kid for refusing to go to a sleepover? | My close friend (we'll call her S) asked if her daughter (we'll call her M), who doesn't go out that often, could have a sleepover with my teenage daughter (we'll call her J), who also doesn't go out that often. Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying. So AITA for trying to get my kid to have more friends?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting friends of my friends stay at my moms' place? | Usual disclaimer, I'm on mobile so sorry about the formating and english not my first language.\n\nFor a little background, in my hometown, there is a fairly famous four day festival that I go to every year with the same friend group from this town. But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore.

She never scolds the child for being naughty, she comforts the child even when wrong and tries to prevent every frustration of the child's desires.  \n\nNow, the problem is this: She doesn't allow her new husband to play any role in the life of E. E is a terrible child, pouty, manipulative and outright savage. Her doting mother S is ALWAYS on her side and lets her do whatever she wants. S tells me things like how she thinks naughty, misbehaving children are cute and that she wants to \"protect\" her child. I might add that S suffers from severe anxiety disorder, so I do not trust her to actually be able to make the difference between a real threat and an imagined one. Whenever her new husband tries to make E behave, E ends up screaming and throwing a tantrum. \n\nOf course, S steps in, blames her husband, consoles the child and basically rewards the child for first misbehaving and then making a scene about being told off.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here.

We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying. So AITA for trying to get my kid to have more friends?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting friends of my friends stay at my moms' place? | Usual disclaimer, I'm on mobile so sorry about the formating and english not my first language.\n\nFor a little background, in my hometown, there is a fairly famous four day festival that I go to every year with the same friend group from this town. But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore. Especially after he promised me free drinks on saturday at the bar he works at. \ud83d\ude0a\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for demanding my gf, who has never lived on her own, to live on her own first before I move in with her? | context.\n\ngf and I have been going at it for almost a year, and the idea of moving in together came up. but she has never lived on her own, and she doesn't understand concepts like 'first and last month rent is due at signing'.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends. As such most years for my birthday I\u2019ve just done things with my family. Mostly stuff at home with cake, maybe a movie, sometimes going out to eat etc. \n\nMy birthday is on a Monday this year so not great lol. I figured we could do something on the Saturday or Sunday before though. When I went to my mom to discuss what I might want to do, maybe go to the movies and go out for dinner,she brushed me off a bit. \u201cYeah I guess we can do that.\u201d \u201cWell we\u2019ll have to see - your  dad might want to do something else that day.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the family would like eating at that place.\u201d It just felt cold and like we weren\u2019t even talking about a birthday. I know it\u2019s stupid  to care so much about birthdays as an adult but like.... is it really bad to want to celebrate a bit when I work hard all week? My parents are retired and there\u2019s nothing majorly stressful at home going on rn so I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re acting this way. \n\nWIBTA if I don\u2019t remind my mom to talk to my dad or discuss this anymore and just let them forget about my birthday and doing anything?

Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.)

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too.

Instead she called her father and had him bring a hoodie, which she tied around her waist, and finished working.\n\nToday my boss came to me and said she'd heard what I did to to S, and told me I have no right to berate volunteers-I did not berate her. My boss didn't listen, and said that people like S and her family keep our shelter afloat and I should be ashamed for bullying a younger girl on her size. I am in my forties. She gave me an official warning (our shelter works on a marks system, if you get too many you get fired).\n\nAlso, I did manage to get my boss to relay what she had been told and to me it doesn't sound like she has an exaggerated version.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.  Very cute. Good girl.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I let my parents forget my 21st birthday? | Ever since I started my new job, I haven\u2019t been talking to my parents much. I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore. Especially after he promised me free drinks on saturday at the bar he works at. \ud83d\ude0a\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for demanding my gf, who has never lived on her own, to live on her own first before I move in with her? | context.\n\ngf and I have been going at it for almost a year, and the idea of moving in together came up. but she has never lived on her own, and she doesn't understand concepts like 'first and last month rent is due at signing'.

We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day.

Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability.

Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally.

Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.)

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore.

No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying. So AITA for trying to get my kid to have more friends?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting friends of my friends stay at my moms' place? | Usual disclaimer, I'm on mobile so sorry about the formating and english not my first language.\n\nFor a little background, in my hometown, there is a fairly famous four day festival that I go to every year with the same friend group from this town. But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore. Especially after he promised me free drinks on saturday at the bar he works at. \ud83d\ude0a\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for demanding my gf, who has never lived on her own, to live on her own first before I move in with her? | context.\n\ngf and I have been going at it for almost a year, and the idea of moving in together came up. but she has never lived on her own, and she doesn't understand concepts like 'first and last month rent is due at signing'.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too.

I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.  Very cute. Good girl.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I let my parents forget my 21st birthday? | Ever since I started my new job, I haven\u2019t been talking to my parents much. I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends.

Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills.

I\u2019m definitely going to talk to my cousin about Hanna. As many commenters suggested, I\u2019m not even going to mention the word \u201cautism\u201d when I talk to Hanna\u2019s parents.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying. So AITA for trying to get my kid to have more friends?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting friends of my friends stay at my moms' place? | Usual disclaimer, I'm on mobile so sorry about the formating and english not my first language.\n\nFor a little background, in my hometown, there is a fairly famous four day festival that I go to every year with the same friend group from this town. But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore. Especially after he promised me free drinks on saturday at the bar he works at. \ud83d\ude0a\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for demanding my gf, who has never lived on her own, to live on her own first before I move in with her? | context.\n\ngf and I have been going at it for almost a year, and the idea of moving in together came up. but she has never lived on her own, and she doesn't understand concepts like 'first and last month rent is due at signing'. AITA for then demanding she learn to live on her own first before I move in with her?\n\nEdit: hello everyone, I\u2019d like to thank you all for judging me on how much of an asshole I\u2019ve been, I talked to my gf about how I can\u2019t afford to take care of her me and rent and emergency contingencies for the next 6 months, and she said she will save up a substantial amount of money before we move in together and she said she\u2019ll help me pay my student loans as well so I feel really good about the resolution of this fight I had.

I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too.

I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here.

This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends. As such most years for my birthday I\u2019ve just done things with my family. Mostly stuff at home with cake, maybe a movie, sometimes going out to eat etc. \n\nMy birthday is on a Monday this year so not great lol.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved.

No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore.

I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.  Very cute. Good girl.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I let my parents forget my 21st birthday? | Ever since I started my new job, I haven\u2019t been talking to my parents much. I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too.

Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too.

I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying. So AITA for trying to get my kid to have more friends?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting friends of my friends stay at my moms' place? | Usual disclaimer, I'm on mobile so sorry about the formating and english not my first language.\n\nFor a little background, in my hometown, there is a fairly famous four day festival that I go to every year with the same friend group from this town. But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends.

She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore.

When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore.

Thanks guys! \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my mom to stop buying gifts for my girlfriend? | My girlfriend and her mom have a weird relationship. Her mom isn\u2019t very supportive of her and makes her feel worse when she\u2019s already down. For example, my girlfriend has a chronic illness and it flared up during our anniversary weekend, when we were staying at my parents\u2019 before we went into the city to celebrate. When my girlfriend texted her mom, her mom said \u201cGreat, now you\u2019re a burden on his parents\u201d, even though my parents weren\u2019t taking care of her and didn\u2019t mind, in fact they were worried. Overall, just not the best mother.\n\nOne other thing she does, is not ever really buy my girlfriend gifts or celebrate her accomplishments. My girlfriend doesn\u2019t feel entitled to them, but even just a card acknowledging her birthday sometimes would be appreciated. My girlfriend does theatre and her mom never gets her flowers or cards or anything to celebrate that, if she even shows up to the performances at all. It makes my girlfriend sad, because she feels like her mom doesn\u2019t give a shit. She\u2019s tried talking to her about it, but her mom makes excuses.\n\nThe thing is, my mom is very supportive, which is sweet. She\u2019ll show up to every show my girlfriend is in, which is great. But she ends up going over the top, buying her flowers and gifts. My girlfriend is appreciative, but then gets upset saying \u201cYour mom is so much nicer to me than my own mom, why can\u2019t she be like that?\u201d\n\nIt all sort of came to a head recently. I knew that my girlfriend\u2019s mom was coming to my girlfriend\u2019s summer performance and that she was giving her a coupon for clothes shopping, which I knew that would make my girlfriend upset. So, I asked my mom to not make a big deal of it and to not get my girlfriend flowers or anything fancy. It was just going to upstage her mom, then upset her and make her go into a tailspin about how her mom sucks, and how my mom loves her more. My mom showed up to the performance with a bouquet of flowers, a pair of earrings and a card. Low and behold, after the performance, I had to hear the same thing. My mom loves her more. Why is her mom so uncaring, why can\u2019t she give her gifts and a card? The same thing, same cycle.\n\nSo, I was upset with my mom and my mom thinks it\u2019s ridiculous that I am upset with her.

        "test_prompt": "\"\"\"AITA for yelling at my mom over joking about my cat dying? | I had Tiger for close to 15 years. She was a beautiful calico, and I couldn't have asked for a better girl. My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.  Very cute. Good girl.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I let my parents forget my 21st birthday? | Ever since I started my new job, I haven\u2019t been talking to my parents much. I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends. As such most years for my birthday I\u2019ve just done things with my family. Mostly stuff at home with cake, maybe a movie, sometimes going out to eat etc. \n\nMy birthday is on a Monday this year so not great lol. I figured we could do something on the Saturday or Sunday before though. When I went to my mom to discuss what I might want to do, maybe go to the movies and go out for dinner,she brushed me off a bit. \u201cYeah I guess we can do that.\u201d \u201cWell we\u2019ll have to see - your  dad might want to do something else that day.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the family would like eating at that place.\u201d It just felt cold and like we weren\u2019t even talking about a birthday. I know it\u2019s stupid  to care so much about birthdays as an adult but like.... is it really bad to want to celebrate a bit when I work hard all week? My parents are retired and there\u2019s nothing majorly stressful at home going on rn so I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re acting this way. \n\nWIBTA if I don\u2019t remind my mom to talk to my dad or discuss this anymore and just let them forget about my birthday and doing anything? My mom forgot my 18th birthday a few years ago until about noon that day and she felt awful, but this time I feel like she wouldn\u2019t even really care.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I reported a subreddit for AP students to the CollegeBoard Office of Testing Integrity since they're discussing answers on the test during the 48 hour limit period? | So I took an AP exam this week (I will keep it ambiguous), and they tell us that we are not allowed to discuss the test material for 48 hours after the test, and never if it's not published to the CollegeBoard site.\n\nI see people on a certain subreddit who are discussing the test material, and my OCD is wanting me to report them. But I'm not sure if I should and if they'd be able to see who it is.\n\nWIBTA or no.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I tell my cousin that I think her daughter needs therapy? | Preface: I\u2019m 20, but I have worked as a basketball coach since I was 15. I primarily teach the junior classes (ages 4-10). Some of our kids have special needs (like ADHD, epilepsy, autism, etc) and we work with these kids to help them all succeed. \n\nMy cousin\u2019s daughter Hanna is 8. Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.) I\u2019m not a qualified mental health professional, and I don\u2019t want to do an armchair diagnosis\nc.) it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my business, as I am not Hanna\u2019s parent\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the judgement and advice! I\u2019m definitely going to talk to my cousin about Hanna. As many commenters suggested, I\u2019m not even going to mention the word \u201cautism\u201d when I talk to Hanna\u2019s parents. I\u2019ll bring up the idea of counseling for Hanna to become more socially adjusted. Hopefully a qualified professional will help with Hanna\u2019s situation.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for embarrassing my son? | It was my sons 13th birthday a while ago, I had him the day after.\n\nThe plan was my ex, Tiff, threw a party and I had him the next day.\n\nI told son he could have 6 friends over.\n\nSon arrives at mine with bags of snacks and money for pizza, at his favourite place.\n\nThere was like \u00a350 worth of snacks, maybe more and money for  his favourite pizza place, which is like \u00a313 for a small pizza each, it's a small business so it's understandable.\n\nI have two daughters, 7 and 9.\n\nHe refused to share his snacks with them and refused to share his pizza, claiming because his mum sent it and it was his day he didnt have to.\n\nI made him share and we got from pizza hut instead (I sent the spare money back with him)\n\nHe is now refusing to talk to me and his mother tells me she can \"*understand both sides*\" but still tells me I was an asshole in the situation, she says she didnt send food for his siblings.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA if I yelled at my kid for refusing to go to a sleepover? | My close friend (we'll call her S) asked if her daughter (we'll call her M), who doesn't go out that often, could have a sleepover with my teenage daughter (we'll call her J), who also doesn't go out that often. Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved.

No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships.

Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability.

That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore. Especially after he promised me free drinks on saturday at the bar he works at. \ud83d\ude0a\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for demanding my gf, who has never lived on her own, to live on her own first before I move in with her? | context.\n\ngf and I have been going at it for almost a year, and the idea of moving in together came up. but she has never lived on her own, and she doesn't understand concepts like 'first and last month rent is due at signing'.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying.

But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore.

My dad saved her from being attacked by another cat when she was only a kitten. We couldn't have pets at the house, so we took her to my great grandmother's (Nanny) house. We (my siblings and I) were at her house every weekend, so we saw Tiger often. Nanny loved her, and reminded us often that was our cat. She looked after Tiger until we got a new place a few years later and could finally take her home with us. I was elated when we finally got to bring her home and love her every day. I can't remember a time she wasn't in my life. She was truly the best girl. \n\nI'm 22 and in college, but I come home most weekends. Tiger went missing a few weeks ago, and I wasn't told until she had already been missing for 2 weeks. There's still a chance she could come home, but given her age, it isn't a probability. I was devastated when my mom told me. She had a huge grin on her face when she told me, like she'd been waiting for this to happen for a long time.\n\nFast forward to about a week later. I was sitting on the couch, and my mom was standing nearby in the Kitchen. She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.

I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends.

She was playing with the dog, and said, (in the way people talk to babies or animals) \"Do you want to eat Tiger's food since she's dead?\"\nObviously this really bothered me, but I ignored it. That only made it worse. \"[My name],\" she said at least 3 times, \"[My name]... did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said about Tiger?\" She was cackling as she said it. Maybe I overreacted, but I blew up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but there was a lot of cussing, followed by me trying to hide my tears. Her only response was, \"wow you're really mad at me?\"\n\nA day or so later, I was feeling down, and I was being cold toward her. She kept pestering me about my \"attitude\" and saying things like, \"I can't believe you're really still mad at me. It was just a joke.\" I tried to explain why I was upset and said that if the situation were reversed and I were making fun of her dog dying, she'd be upset too. She literally laughed in my face.\n\nPart of me feels validated for feeling the way that I do and for yelling at her, and part of me feels awful.\n\nEdit: there is a picture of her in my post history.  10/10 would reccomend.  Very cute. Good girl.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I let my parents forget my 21st birthday? | Ever since I started my new job, I haven\u2019t been talking to my parents much. I live with them, but when I come home from work, they seem to kind of ignore me and not talk to me much when I try and engage in conversation. I make my own dinners and my mom has never offered to help me cook after work or asked me what I\u2019m having and just cooks for her, my dad and brother without any regard for me. This may sound like not a big issue but bprjor to this job I would help my mom cook a lot and we would all eat together and now it\u2019s kind of like they don\u2019t care. \n\nFor a few different reasons (anxiety disorder),I don\u2019t  really have a lot of friends. As such most years for my birthday I\u2019ve just done things with my family. Mostly stuff at home with cake, maybe a movie, sometimes going out to eat etc. \n\nMy birthday is on a Monday this year so not great lol. I figured we could do something on the Saturday or Sunday before though. When I went to my mom to discuss what I might want to do, maybe go to the movies and go out for dinner,she brushed me off a bit. \u201cYeah I guess we can do that.\u201d \u201cWell we\u2019ll have to see - your  dad might want to do something else that day.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the family would like eating at that place.\u201d It just felt cold and like we weren\u2019t even talking about a birthday. I know it\u2019s stupid  to care so much about birthdays as an adult but like.... is it really bad to want to celebrate a bit when I work hard all week? My parents are retired and there\u2019s nothing majorly stressful at home going on rn so I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re acting this way. \n\nWIBTA if I don\u2019t remind my mom to talk to my dad or discuss this anymore and just let them forget about my birthday and doing anything? My mom forgot my 18th birthday a few years ago until about noon that day and she felt awful, but this time I feel like she wouldn\u2019t even really care.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I reported a subreddit for AP students to the CollegeBoard Office of Testing Integrity since they're discussing answers on the test during the 48 hour limit period? | So I took an AP exam this week (I will keep it ambiguous), and they tell us that we are not allowed to discuss the test material for 48 hours after the test, and never if it's not published to the CollegeBoard site.\n\nI see people on a certain subreddit who are discussing the test material, and my OCD is wanting me to report them. But I'm not sure if I should and if they'd be able to see who it is.\n\nWIBTA or no.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I tell my cousin that I think her daughter needs therapy? | Preface: I\u2019m 20, but I have worked as a basketball coach since I was 15. I primarily teach the junior classes (ages 4-10). Some of our kids have special needs (like ADHD, epilepsy, autism, etc) and we work with these kids to help them all succeed. \n\nMy cousin\u2019s daughter Hanna is 8. Ever since she was 4-5, I\u2019ve suspected that she\u2019s on the spectrum. She\u2019s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She\u2019s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna\u2019s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn\u2019t shower on her own anymore. \n\nMy cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn\u2019t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. \n\nWIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?\n\nI\u2019m hesitant because\na.) it\u2019s possible that Hanna\u2019s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it\nb.) I\u2019m not a qualified mental health professional, and I don\u2019t want to do an armchair diagnosis\nc.) it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my business, as I am not Hanna\u2019s parent\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the judgement and advice! I\u2019m definitely going to talk to my cousin about Hanna. As many commenters suggested, I\u2019m not even going to mention the word \u201cautism\u201d when I talk to Hanna\u2019s parents. I\u2019ll bring up the idea of counseling for Hanna to become more socially adjusted. Hopefully a qualified professional will help with Hanna\u2019s situation.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for embarrassing my son? | It was my sons 13th birthday a while ago, I had him the day after.\n\nThe plan was my ex, Tiff, threw a party and I had him the next day.\n\nI told son he could have 6 friends over.\n\nSon arrives at mine with bags of snacks and money for pizza, at his favourite place.\n\nThere was like \u00a350 worth of snacks, maybe more and money for  his favourite pizza place, which is like \u00a313 for a small pizza each, it's a small business so it's understandable.\n\nI have two daughters, 7 and 9.\n\nHe refused to share his snacks with them and refused to share his pizza, claiming because his mum sent it and it was his day he didnt have to.\n\nI made him share and we got from pizza hut instead (I sent the spare money back with him)\n\nHe is now refusing to talk to me and his mother tells me she can \"*understand both sides*\" but still tells me I was an asshole in the situation, she says she didnt send food for his siblings.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA if I yelled at my kid for refusing to go to a sleepover? | My close friend (we'll call her S) asked if her daughter (we'll call her M), who doesn't go out that often, could have a sleepover with my teenage daughter (we'll call her J), who also doesn't go out that often. Seven years ago, J and M were good friends, but they drifted apart after we moved. But since we've come back, S and I have been trying to get J and M to become friends again.\n\nHowever, J has only put a little amount of effort into making new friends since we've moved, yet she's complained that she still doesn't have any close friends yet, so my wife and I signed her up for multiple activities, like a boat trip with our church and a sleepover with M. No matter what we try, J says no, citing that she doesn't know or trust the people in question, stating that she finds it both awkward and intrusive to go into activities that she isn't a part of, and mentioning how much she dislikes being forced into relationships. Even then, she clearly doesn't understand that our public image is at stake every time she digs a deeper hole for her socially reclusive self. Plus, she doesn't see that my wife and I just want her to be happy again.\n\nSo, today, when J turned down the sleepover opportunity with M, I blew up. I said that she's ruining my friendship with S, that she's ruining both her and our family's image, that she doesn't have any friends anyway, that she doesn't have anything to do with her time besides her using her laptop and her phone, that people have begun noticing that she doesn't have any friends, and that she's a bad daughter. It went on for a good thirty minutes, and I do believe that I was releasing work frustrations on her accidentally. My daughter didn't react much, except giving me a slight glare, and that made me feel guilty. However, I still believe that I was right in the majority of what I'm saying. So AITA for trying to get my kid to have more friends?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting friends of my friends stay at my moms' place? | Usual disclaimer, I'm on mobile so sorry about the formating and english not my first language.\n\nFor a little background, in my hometown, there is a fairly famous four day festival that I go to every year with the same friend group from this town. But I study in a different city and have some friends there as well. \n\nOne of those friends from uni, let's call him Jimmy, is going to this festival this year too. When he told me about it, I offered our guest bedroom because maybe he'd like to shower or something during the festival. I know him well and my mum would be fine with it. \n\nNow at this point I thought that Jimmy would come along with us. Then he asked if he could bring another friend of ours and if that friend could sleep in out guest bedroom too. Since I know that friend well I said yes. \n\nNow, this friend is not coming anymore because of work. And Jimmy has asked if he could bring two other people to stay at our place for the festival. I've met them a couple of times, but I don't particularly like them. I understand that Jimmy wants to have people at the festival that he knows and can hang out with other than my friends (that he doesn't know). But I feel uncomfortable with his friends staying in our guest bedroom. The room would fit them all. I don't think that they would behave badly and that it would be a big deal though.\n\nI told Jimmy that I don't like the idea of having his friends stay at my mums place because I don't know them well. My mum is only okay with having people over that she doesn't know if I trust them to behave and if I know them, which is very generous in my opinion. I don't want to take advantage of this, therefore I'm not going to have them stay here. \n\nJimmy was not happy about it and thinks I have double standarts. He won't stay at my place if his friends can't come along and thinks that I'm ruining his festival. Now I don't think I'm being unreasonable but I'd still like to hear if I'm in the wrong here. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I added paragraphs.\n\nEdit 2: thank you all for the comments. I'm assured that I didn't do something unreasonable by not allowing them to stay here. The festival is months away and they have plenty time to figure something out. And bonus: Jimmy has apologized for asking and his reaction after my reply, so I'm obviously not mad anymore. Especially after he promised me free drinks on saturday at the bar he works at. \ud83d\ude0a\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for demanding my gf, who has never lived on her own, to live on her own first before I move in with her? | context.\n\ngf and I have been going at it for almost a year, and the idea of moving in together came up. but she has never lived on her own, and she doesn't understand concepts like 'first and last month rent is due at signing'. AITA for then demanding she learn to live on her own first before I move in with her?\n\nEdit: hello everyone, I\u2019d like to thank you all for judging me on how much of an asshole I\u2019ve been, I talked to my gf about how I can\u2019t afford to take care of her me and rent and emergency contingencies for the next 6 months, and she said she will save up a substantial amount of money before we move in together and she said she\u2019ll help me pay my student loans as well so I feel really good about the resolution of this fight I had. Thanks guys! \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disciplining someone else's kid? | I was at a BBQ with my partner. There was a fair few people there and a whole bunch of kids. I don't have kids myself but I don't mind being around them. \nSo everyone was having a good time, drinks, finger food and the kids were having a good time running around with water guns and water bombs as it was a hot day.

The kid then continued to spray me.. after about the 4th time I said that it was enough and to please stop. The parents just kept laughing (I had not met them before the bbq). The next time the kid sprayed me, I grabbed his arm and took the water gun off him which resulted in him bawling his eyes out. I refused to give the water gun back and this resulted in the parents having a go at me.
