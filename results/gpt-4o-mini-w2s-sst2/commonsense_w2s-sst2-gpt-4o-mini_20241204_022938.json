Your room is your personal space, and it\u2019s important for you to have privacy and autonomy, especially as you're approaching adulthood. It seems like you communicated your need for space and time to manage your responsibilities, and it\u2019s not fair for your mom to disregard that.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that parents often want to help and may feel overwhelmed when they see a messy room, going through your belongings without your permission crosses a boundary. It\u2019s important for parents to trust their children and respect their privacy, especially at your age.\n\nIn this situation, it seems like both you and your mom could benefit from a calm conversation about boundaries and respect. It might help to express how her actions made you feel and to listen to her perspective as well. Open communication can often lead to a better understanding on both sides.\n\nSo, to answer your question: No, you are not the asshole for being upset. Your feelings are valid, and it\u2019s important to address this issue with your mom when you feel ready.",

While it's commendable that you and your husband have made a commitment to a vegan lifestyle and are trying to instill those values in your children, it's also important to consider their feelings and autonomy as they grow older. \n\nYour children are at an age where they are beginning to assert their independence and make their own choices, including what they eat. Grounding your daughter for ordering pizza when you weren't home may have escalated the situation and made her feel more resentful rather than understanding your perspective. \n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your kids about your family's values and the reasons behind your dietary choices. At the same time, it could be beneficial to allow them some flexibility and autonomy in their food choices, especially since they are eating meat outside of the home. \n\nUltimately, it\u2019s about finding a balance between your family's values and respecting your children's growing independence.

It was in good shape, almost new. I'm not a fat ass, but I stood on it for less than a minute, and the board broke in half. I felt bad, so I instantly offered the kid one of my (better) wooden skateboards. He's too young to understand quality, so he wants a plastic one again. Fine. \nI walk him home and tell his mom what happened. I offer to replace his skateboard. She tells me it was about $40 (for a piece of shit that broke in half?), and she got it on Amazon. We go back and forth a couple of days because they no longer have the same color, though I'm willing to get him the same board different color. \nNow, yesterday at the bus stop where are kids get on/off together, I told her I'm ordering the skateboard. She asks if I ordered it yet. I said, \"No, because I just want to make sure it's a color your son wants.\" She then tells me, \"Well, if you can't get the same color, it's okay. We'll just take the cash for it.\"\nThat just gave me a weird feeling. I'm happy to replace the skateboard, but don't like the idea of just giving them cash instead. It makes me feel like maybe this kid didn't even like skateboarding anyway, and this was an opportunity to get his money back. \nAITA for not wanting to give cash back? I'm happy to order the same board for him, but a different color. \nAge wise, he's probably about 8 or 9. I'm dad-age, with a first grader  and a two year old.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems like you are trying to do the right thing by offering to replace the skateboard instead of just giving cash. You feel that replacing the item shows more thought and care than simply handing over money. It's understandable to want to ensure that the child receives something he will enjoy, rather than just giving cash that might not be used for the intended purpose.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the other parent's perspective. They may feel that cash would be more convenient, especially if they don't want to deal with the hassle of returning or exchanging the item. \n\nUltimately, you are not wrong for wanting to replace the skateboard with a different color, as you are trying to be considerate and responsible. However, it might be worth discussing this further with the child's parent to understand their perspective and come to a mutual agreement. Communication is key in resolving this situation amicably.",

I work for a commercial real-estate company in Milwaukee as a maintenance man. I handle over 3 million square feet of property (mostly very old) along with my supervisor. One of our buildings has recently become vacant due to the previous tenant moving. Over the past few months we have had serious criminal damage done to the property resulting in a lot of calls to the local PD and beefed up security (cameras and barbed wire fence). \n\nAbout 2 weeks ago I make my bi-weekly lap around the building looking for more damage and checking cameras. To my delight I find nothing, at first. As I get to the back of the building where the railroad is, I notice a lot of new garbage. Mostly cheap beer and liquor bottles along with McDonald's wrappers flying around. I walk to where one of the service doors was spray painted and find a pile of blankets and more garbage.\n\nIt took me a second but I realized there was a person under the blanket. I wake the guy up and ask him if everything is alright. He goes on to say he's just trying to stay warm from the winter weather pushing in and he thought this spot was well enough out of the way as to not be bothered. I say not a problem, just so long as you clean up the garbage I'm fine with you staying here. I told him about the kids tearing the place apart and advised him not to stick around during the day, less the police or my boss find someone at \"the scene of the crime\" so to speak. He said no worries I'll clean up and be on my way. I think nothing more of it and go about my day.\n\nA week later I do my walkthrough and what do I find but the same garbage, plus more, and someone else sleeping in the same spot. I wake him up and ask about the beer cans scattered around. He says none of it is his even though I see amongst his belongings are 3 more unopened beers of the same type. Slightly annoyed, I explain to this guy the exact same thing I told the other man. You can stay, please clean up. He says no problem I'll do it before I leave. I say thank you, and ask him if he knows the other guy that sleeps here. He nods and I ask him to remind him about cleaning up.\n\nTwo days later I come back to more garbage. Now I'm upset. When our buildings accrue an excess of garbage the city will give us a warning and then begin to fine us. I find the second guy and give him one last chance. I tell him to clean up or next time I'm going to have to involve the police. I find the first guy sleeping under a loading dock and explain the same. I told both of them I don't want to call the police but I can't just let you continue to stay here making a mess. Going on to state how if my boss found out I was giving them a second chance let alone a third, how I would be fired. Again the agree to clean up, so I leave.\n\nToday I find neither of them, but the garbage and their personal items are still there. So as promised I call the non-emergency number and explain to them the situation. I ask them if there is anything they can do and they say it's out of their hands unless damage is being done. The tell me that I am allowed to remove the garbage/items. I wait around the building for an hour hoping to spot one of the homeless men, but nothing. It's at this point I make the decision to move all of the stuff inside our building. I came back to that building 3 more times throughout the day hoping to find one of them and return the items on the condition they don't come back.\n\nI didn't see either of them, however their items are safe and I do plan on returning first thing in the morning.

There is one computer science teacher (40s-50sM) at my high school, and I've taken three of his classes across two years -- all As, the only 5 on the AP comp sci test from our school last year. I've also participated in/later held leadership positions in the coding and robotics teams he runs after school. Both of these teams have placed in competitions each year I've participated, after consistently taking last place in previous years. I also won two of the coding competitions individually and was the sole coder for robotics when we took first my junior year (last year).\n\nTL;DR All of that to say, I think I'm competent in comp sci, and this teacher is in a unique position to vouch for that.\n\nI asked him to please write me a letter of recommendation, and he said he was happy to. He did that for many members of our teams who were planning to go into computer science. I didn't opt out of being allowed to read recommendation letters before I attach them, and his is not really what I was looking for. In two pages, he references my \"beautiful smile\", boys in the class being \"no-doubt distracted by her beauty\" (??), me being an animal lover and me having a nice singing voice. He barely brushes on anything related to computer science or even my competence in general (I had the highest PSAT/SAT scores in our year too, which he knows), and includes a lot of irrelevant information. He references my appearance four separate times, and he only mentions the coding team as part of a story about me being happy to pet a dog that they brought after the competition -- making no mention of me winning the individual portion of the competition itself. It's not a mean letter at all, but I still think it hurts my chances if anything because it makes it seem like someone who's known me in a comp sci setting for years can't really speak to any abilities -- or even like I didn't earn my grades in his classes, which I know I did. In my mom's words, it makes me \"look like a bimbo\".\n\nTL;DR: Letter did not reference any computer science competency. Includes a lot of frivolous information, unintentionally makes me look ditzy.\n\nAnyway, he asked if the letter had made it to the system so I told him yes, and thank you, but that there were a few changes I'd like if that was alright. I explained what they were, and he got pretty offended and said he was doing me a favor, etc. I understand he didn't have to write me a letter at all, and I still appreciate the effort. I offered to rewrite it myself for him to submit so he doesn't have to put more time into it, but he declined. Am I the A for taking issue with a favor if the favor isn't actually helpful?\n\nTL;DR: Teacher got offended I asked for changes to his letter. AITA?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you have valid concerns about the content of the recommendation letter. While it's understandable that the teacher may have felt offended by your request for changes, it's also important for a recommendation letter to accurately reflect your abilities and achievements, especially in a competitive field like computer science.\n\nYou have demonstrated significant accomplishments in your studies and extracurricular activities, and it's reasonable to expect that a recommendation letter would highlight those strengths rather than focus on irrelevant details. Since you have offered to rewrite the letter yourself, it shows that you are willing to take responsibility for the situation and ensure that the letter accurately represents you.\n\nIn this case, you are not the \"A\" for wanting a more relevant and competent recommendation letter. It's important for you to advocate for yourself, especially when it comes to your future education and career. However, it might be beneficial to approach the teacher again, expressing your appreciation for his efforts while explaining why you feel the letter needs to be more focused on your academic and technical skills. Communication and understanding can go a long way in resolving this issue.",

It's understandable that she feels betrayed, as she believed she had a legitimate allergy. \n\nIn this situation, it's important to consider the impact of your actions on your children's understanding of honesty and trust. While your intentions were to protect their health, the method you used may not have been the best approach in the long run. \n\nUltimately, it might be beneficial to have an open conversation with your children about your reasoning and the importance of healthy eating, while also acknowledging their feelings about the situation.

However, many people might feel that disclosing a felony conviction is important information that should be shared upfront, especially in the context of dating. \n\nWhile you may not want to lead with your past mistake, it is also important to consider how potential partners might feel about being kept in the dark about something significant. In this case, it seems that the girl you were dating felt misled when she found out about your felony conviction after getting to know you. \n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance between being honest and allowing someone to get to know you as a person beyond your past mistakes. It might be helpful to include a brief mention of your past in your dating profile, perhaps framing it in a way that emphasizes your growth and the lessons you've learned since then. \n\nIn summary, while you may not be the \"asshole\" in this situation, it could be beneficial to be more transparent in your dating profile to avoid misunderstandings in the future.",

Communication is key here. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with both Lisa and James about your feelings and the importance of the veil to your family, while also listening to Lisa's intentions and desires.\n\nUltimately, it's about finding a compromise that respects both your family's traditions and Lisa's wishes. Perhaps there could be a way for her to use the veil without permanently altering it, or maybe she could create a replica that she can modify while keeping the original intact. \n\nIn conclusion, while your feelings are valid, it's important to approach the situation with empathy and a willingness to find a solution that honors both sides.",

        "model_response": "It sounds like you were going through a very difficult time after losing your beloved cat, and it's understandable that you needed some time alone to process your grief. However, the way you handled the situation by not communicating with your wife and leaving without discussing it with her first has understandably upset her. Relationships thrive on communication, especially during tough times. \n\nWhile it's important to take care of your mental health, it's also crucial to involve your partner in your feelings and decisions, especially after such a significant loss. It might be helpful to have an open conversation with your wife about your feelings and the reasons behind your decision to go away alone. This could help both of you understand each other better and work through the situation together.\n\nIn this case, it seems that you may not be the \"a-hole,\" but the lack of communication and consideration for your wife's feelings is a concern. It would be beneficial to address this with her and find a way to move forward together.",

I have small children at home, and a large part of my mental space is occupied by thinking about how I can ensure that my family has a generally healthy diet. I'm not completely obsessed. The kids eat cake and ice cream at parties. We take them out to ice cream now and then. I give them a few pieces of chocolate in their lunches. We do a special breakfast once a week where the kids can vote on pancakes, waffles, crepes, etc. But I see healthy eating as one of the most important values that I can instill in my family.\n\nThe kids usually choose crepes for their special breakfast. These are the richest and least healthy option. I make pancakes and waffles with wheat and oat flour, but crepes I do by our traditional family recipe--butter, sugar, white flour\u2026 It's a special treat, and I want them to enjoy it. The only filling we use is pure maple syrup, and the one thing I ask is that we don't use a ton of it. Crepe batter is super rich, maple syrup has lots of sugar, and it is very expensive. I tell them a little goes a long way. Plus, it's healthier to use just a little!\n\nWe roll our crepes like a burrito, and just like putting ingredients in a burrito, I ask everyone to apply a single line of syrup down the center along the roll rather than pouring haphazardly all over the surface. Not only does it help us use less, but it\u2019s reasonable given the burrito roll method. (When you cut it into small sections, each bite will have the same amount of syrup in the center.) The kids get the rationale, and I make sure that I lead by example.\n\nMy wife can't get behind the single line of syrup thing though. She likes sweet things and uses lots of syrup on her crepes. She pours in a spiral over the whole surface, using about 3x what anyone else does. For a long time, when she helped the kids fill their crepes, she refused to pour a single line, instead slathering syrup all over. I think it was a sort of protest, as she sees me as being too nitpicky. After a lot of complaining on my part, she did change, but it was a real headache.\n\nI want her to jump on board with the syrup thing so that we can send a consistent message to the kids. I have suggested this to her on various occasions and explained my reasoning carefully. I don't think it's unreasonable or irrational to think that we should have a family policy around this, and I have trouble understanding why this should represent a significant problem for her.\n\nShe thinks I'm being unreasonable and irrational in asking this of her--that it's purely a matter of preference and that I shouldn't be pressuring her in any direction. I want us to be a team on this. This is the only breakfast for which I feel the need to have such family standards--I don't say anything specific about pancakes, waffles, etc. (you need to spread syrup all over the surface of those, although I do still want people to be modest about syrup use).\n\nAITA?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you are trying to instill healthy eating habits in your family, which is commendable. However, it is also important to recognize that everyone has their own preferences when it comes to food, including your wife. While you have a valid point about wanting to teach your children moderation and healthy eating, it may be more effective to approach this issue with flexibility and understanding rather than insisting on a strict rule.\n\nInstead of trying to impose a specific way of using syrup, consider discussing the importance of moderation and healthy choices with your wife in a more collaborative manner. Perhaps you could agree on a compromise that allows for some flexibility while still promoting healthy habits. For example, you could suggest that everyone uses a smaller amount of syrup and then allows individuals to add more if they feel it's necessary, rather than dictating a specific method.\n\nUltimately, it's important to maintain open communication and respect each other's preferences in the kitchen. A collaborative approach will likely lead to a more harmonious family breakfast experience.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, you are not the asshole. You were motivated by the promise of a reward that was advertised, and you spent your time and resources looking for the dog. It's understandable to feel frustrated when the owner claims they can't pay the reward after you put in the effort to find their pet. However, it's important to consider the ethical implications of holding the dog hostage for money. While you may feel justified in your actions, it might be more appropriate to return the dog and explain your disappointment about the lack of reward. Ultimately, it's a complicated situation, but holding the dog for ransom is not a kind or ethical approach.",

During this time I drank heavily, made bad decisions. I had three manic episodes, the last of which was so bad, so traumatic... I finally understood that I needed to do anything and everything to get well. \n\nI was finally officially diagnosed with bipolar and CPTSD. I started intensive therapy, completely quit drinking, basically did a 180 and have stayed on the straight and narrow ever since. I have no desire to go back to where I was, ie pick up a drink. The meds work great, and I am stable and better than I ever have been.\n\nTurns out though, my very comp\u00e9tant psych team is pretty convinced that my mom is a narcissist and that her constant emotional abuse definitely caused my CPTSD and maybe in fact lead to my bipolar. Although I made bad decisions during my years of being sick, I want to be clear that I never DID anything TO anyone in my family, (Stealing, violence, etc) though I definitely said some things I regret, that I have apologized for. \n\nI can completely understand how from my fam\u2019s  perspective it was difficult to see me in that state, however as they are stuck in this narcissistic family unit, they can\u2019t seem to grasp that my mom actually played a big part in it.\n\nIn any event, I have only ever wanted a good relationship with them, and I though that getting sober and on the right track would have helped with that, but it actually has made relations worse, namely with my little sister who thinks I\u2019m \u201cplaying the victim\u201d blaming bipolar  for my years of bad behavior, also for blaming my mom for her abuse. \n\nFor me, I have apologized for my past actions and words. In my view the best way to show my remorse is to take my recovery seriously. I can\u2019t change the past but I can work towards a happy and healthy future. My sister sees this rational as me not owning my past actions, and I resent her, what I see as ignorance about my bipolar (she refuses to look into it to try to understand better).\n\nAITA for not focusing on the past and how to make up for it?

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're going through a very challenging situation, and it's understandable to feel frustrated when your family doesn't seem to recognize the progress you've made in your recovery. It's commendable that you've taken responsibility for your health and are working hard to maintain your sobriety and mental well-being.\n\nFrom what you've shared, it seems that you are not \"playing the victim\" but rather taking ownership of your past and focusing on your recovery. It's unfortunate that your sister doesn't understand the complexities of mental health and the impact of your upbringing. It's important to remember that healing takes time, both for you and for your family members who may need to adjust their perspectives.\n\nIn this situation, it seems you are doing everything you can to move forward positively. You are not responsible for your family's inability to understand your journey, and it's okay to prioritize your own health and happiness. It might be helpful to continue to communicate openly with your family about your progress and the importance of understanding mental health, but ultimately, you should focus on your own well-being.\n\nSo, to answer your question: No, you are not the asshole for focusing on your recovery and wanting to move forward. You deserve to be proud of the work you've done, and it's okay to expect some understanding and support from your family as well.",

The 11-year-old's action of hugging his sister while muddy was done with malice, while the younger siblings did not understand the implications of their actions. You took the time to explain the situation to your daughter and comfort her, which shows that you care about her feelings. \n\nYour decision to punish the 11-year-old while not punishing the younger ones seems fair, as they did not have the same intent. It's understandable that the 11-year-old feels frustrated, but it's important for him to learn about accountability and the consequences of his actions. \n\nOverall, it seems like you handled the situation well, so I would say you are not the asshole in this scenario.",

It's understandable to feel hurt when you perceive that your presence is unwanted, especially after a long day at work. However, it's also important to respect your sister's feelings and her need for privacy in certain conversations. \n\nIn this situation, it might be helpful to have a calm discussion with your sister about how you both feel. Expressing your feelings without yelling or blaming can lead to a better understanding of each other's perspectives. It's possible that your sister didn't mean to make you feel unwelcome, and talking it out could help mend any hurt feelings. \n\nSo, while your feelings are valid, it may be best to approach the situation with empathy and a willingness to listen.",

They stopped attending uni in February, spend all day getting drunk and high off stolen prescription meds as well as class a drugs. They have hives debts and are constantly begging for money. Myself and F have seen L once this summer and 4 days later they asked for a loan. L has been in a psych ward once this summer and has started self-harming really badly.\n\nMyself and F are really worried about F as they are going back to uni in September and will be reunited with friends who encourage this type of behaviour. We were thinking of getting our mums to speak to their mum about L's wellbeing even if it risks our friendship as L is on a bad path and despite multiple attempts to reach out, we don't know if there's anymore we can do.\n\nTLDR: long term friend is abusing drugs and is in debt by thousands and don't know what to do \n\n*Will also be crossposting to r/mentalhealth ",

It's understandable that you and your other friend are worried about L's well-being. \n\nIn situations like this, it's important to approach the matter with care and compassion. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Talk to L**: If you feel comfortable, try reaching out to L directly. Express your concerns without judgment and let them know that you care about their well-being. Sometimes, just knowing that someone is there for them can make a difference.\n\n2. **Involve Trusted Adults**: If you believe L is in danger or unable to help themselves, it might be wise to involve a trusted adult, like their parents. They may be able to provide the support L needs.\n\n3. **Encourage Professional Help**: Suggest that L seek professional help, whether it's therapy, counseling, or a support group. Sometimes, hearing this from friends can encourage someone to take that step.\n\n4. **Set Boundaries**: While it's important to support L, it's also crucial to set boundaries for your own well-being. If L's behavior is affecting you negatively, it's okay to take a step back.\n\n5. **Stay Informed**: Educate yourself about addiction and mental health issues.

Myself and F have kept in regular contact and despite me being ill and resitting a couple of exams we've both been very successful in our first year and have become better people because of it. \n\nHowever, L is struggling. They stopped attending uni in February, spend all day getting drunk and high off stolen prescription meds as well as class a drugs. They have hives debts and are constantly begging for money. Myself and F have seen L once this summer and 4 days later they asked for a loan. L has been in a psych ward once this summer and has started self-harming really badly.\n\nMyself and F are really worried about F as they are going back to uni in September and will be reunited with friends who encourage this type of behaviour. We were thinking of getting our mums to speak to their mum about L's wellbeing even if it risks our friendship as L is on a bad path and despite multiple attempts to reach out, we don't know if there's anymore we can do.\n\nTLDR: long term friend is abusing drugs and is in debt by thousands and don't know what to do \n\n*Will also be crossposting to r/mentalhealth ",

She doesn't want to come home. \n\nFive minutes later he shows up on my doorstep and gives me their youngest (1 year, older two in school) no diaper bag. He wants in. I told him no.

It's important to communicate your feelings to G honestly, but also with compassion. Let her know that you care about her and want the best for her, but that you need to take a break to process everything.\n\nUltimately, it's her decision to make, and you can only support her in the way that feels right for you. If she chooses to go back to a situation that you believe is unhealthy, that's her choice, and you can only hope that she finds the strength to make the right decision for herself in the future.",

It wasn't the landlords responsibility because we had bought and installed the dishwasher ourselves - so it was considered \"our\" problem. Sister said yes. \n\nFast forward to last year and my sister lost her job of 7 years and then lost the replacement job she got due to some illnesses she was going through. Her old job let her go saying she wasn't working up to par and then her new job lied to her, said they didn't require medical certificates and then fired her for not providing medical certificates. So - while waiting for government assistance which took her 2 months - she quickly blew through her savings on rent and bills. \n\nShe was trying to borrow money for rent and our parents offered to pay for 3 months of rent - and she pay them back when she can. After they paid the money - they were quick to change their minds and set up various terms and conditions for the loan. They wanted access to my sisters bank account so that they could control how much she was spending, and wanted my sister to stop going to the basketball team she was on (and had been on for several years that was helping her mental health and keep her physically in shape) for at least a year until she had paid them back, paid her debt (which total would only take 3 months seeing as she got a new, better paying, supportive job at the start of this year), and had 3000 dollars in savings. They wanted complete access to her bank account until all that occured. \n\nSo my sister obviously didn't like that - but because she had already accepted the money and they'd paid it, she wasn't sure what to do. She then had an idea and asked if she could \"call it even\" from the dishwasher she bought (and still had the receipt for) from ages ago. They have now been screaming at her for the last hour about how selfish she is and that buying the dishwasher was her being a good child and 'paying her way' for living there as an adult and are now demanding MORE conditions for her accepting this loan. So - is sister the asshole for even suggesting this - and is sister the asshole now if she (as she is currently telling me she wants to do) just stops talking to my parents in a couple of days because of it all?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that your sister is not the asshole for suggesting that she doesn't pay her parents back for the dishwasher. Given the circumstances surrounding her financial struggles and the unreasonable demands placed on her by her parents in exchange for their assistance, her request seems reasonable. \n\nYour sister's parents are attempting to control her finances and impose conditions that are not fair, especially considering the support they initially offered was meant to help her during a difficult time. It is understandable that she would feel frustrated and overwhelmed by their demands, especially when they seem to disregard her autonomy and well-being.\n\nIf your sister feels that the relationship with her parents is becoming toxic due to their behavior, it may be wise for her to take a step back and reassess her boundaries with them. Ultimately, she deserves to be treated with respect and support, rather than being subjected to unreasonable conditions and control.",

            "input": "AITA for suggesting I don't pay my parents back? | This is on behalf of my older sister - I watched all the arguments go down, so I'm posting. \n\nWhen my older sister (24f) was 19, she had a lot of money saved, and when our dishwasher broke - my mother asked her if she wouldn't mind using about $900 to get a new dishwasher. It wasn't the landlords responsibility because we had bought and installed the dishwasher ourselves - so it was considered \"our\" problem. Sister said yes. \n\nFast forward to last year and my sister lost her job of 7 years and then lost the replacement job she got due to some illnesses she was going through. Her old job let her go saying she wasn't working up to par and then her new job lied to her, said they didn't require medical certificates and then fired her for not providing medical certificates. So - while waiting for government assistance which took her 2 months - she quickly blew through her savings on rent and bills. \n\nShe was trying to borrow money for rent and our parents offered to pay for 3 months of rent - and she pay them back when she can. After they paid the money - they were quick to change their minds and set up various terms and conditions for the loan. They wanted access to my sisters bank account so that they could control how much she was spending, and wanted my sister to stop going to the basketball team she was on (and had been on for several years that was helping her mental health and keep her physically in shape) for at least a year until she had paid them back, paid her debt (which total would only take 3 months seeing as she got a new, better paying, supportive job at the start of this year), and had 3000 dollars in savings. They wanted complete access to her bank account until all that occured. \n\nSo my sister obviously didn't like that - but because she had already accepted the money and they'd paid it, she wasn't sure what to do. She then had an idea and asked if she could \"call it even\" from the dishwasher she bought (and still had the receipt for) from ages ago. They have now been screaming at her for the last hour about how selfish she is and that buying the dishwasher was her being a good child and 'paying her way' for living there as an adult and are now demanding MORE conditions for her accepting this loan. So - is sister the asshole for even suggesting this - and is sister the asshole now if she (as she is currently telling me she wants to do) just stops talking to my parents in a couple of days because of it all?",

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a tough situation. It's understandable to want to protect your friend and ensure that your wedding day is a positive experience for everyone involved. However, it's also important to consider your friend's feelings and the dynamics of her new relationship.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Communicate Openly**: Have an honest conversation with your friend about your concerns. Explain how uncomfortable you felt around her new partner and why you believe it might be best for her to bring someone else or no one at all.\n\n2. **Respect Her Choices**: Ultimately, it's her decision who she brings to your wedding. If she feels strongly about bringing her partner, it may be best to respect that, even if you have reservations.\n\n3. **Focus on Your Day**: Remember that your wedding day is about celebrating love and happiness. If her partner's presence would detract from that, it's worth discussing.\n\n4. **Consider Alternatives**: If you feel strongly about not wanting him there, suggest alternatives, like bringing the wife or another friend. Frame it as a way to ensure everyone has a good time.\n\n5. **Be Prepared for Any Outcome**: Understand that your friend may not agree with your perspective, and be prepared for that possibility. It's important to prioritize your friendship and be willing to compromise.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's not wrong to express your feelings, it's also important to approach the situation delicately to avoid damaging your friendship.",

She's voiced that she'll be bringing him (I put my foot down months ago that she could only bring one of them), and I don't want to single her out. I told her about his behavior towards me at the party, but she insisted he's just very friendly...\n\nI don't want to lose her as my bridesmaid, and I certainly do not want to lose her as a friend either...but am I the asshole if I ask her to bring the wife instead? Or someone else? Or no one at all?",

His biological father is not in the picture and basically never has been. I've always been content with that and started looking to date again when he was around 9 months old. I wasn't expecting to hit the jackpot but I did. My husband is the best man I've ever known and we are the absolute best of friends. He took my son in as his own and loves him to death. I'm so so grateful for him every day and my son adores him. It's just an overall awesome situation I never thought would happen. \n\nOkay. So my husband has always gone back and forth about wanting to have a child of his own. I've gone back and forth about it too since I had my son and ultimately I really, sincerely do not want to have another one. I have a lot of varying reasons for this.\n\n\u00a0My husband does want one of his own. Mostly for the \"novelty\" of having a child with someone you love, passing on genes etc. A child who is biologically his that he helped create. I totally understand why he would want that and I empathize completely with how he feels. Although other times he will say it sounds nice, but he could really live without it and it's not the upmost important thing to him, he sees more benefits to NOT having another one etc. I think he feels like that sincerely at times but deep down he still wants one of his own. \n\nToday it came up again after a long period of time of not discussing it at all. We were talking about some bad shit happening in the world and I said that it's another reason I feel I don't want another child. From there it spiraled. My husband said that I'm denying him the opportunity to have one of his own. He said that I don't want another one because I'm lazy and simply don't want to put in the effort to raise another child. It got nasty. By the end of it after we both kind of cooled down the tone was basically \"if it happens it happens, if it doesn't it's whatever\" but now I feel this massive weight of pressure and guilt that I'm not sure how to get past. \n\nI get where he's coming from. I truly do. And I know theres a big possibility that down the road he will end up resenting me if I don't decide to have another child. But I absolutely cannot force myself to want it. I can't make myself have a kid out of obligation. There is no part of me that wants another kid. Honestly, I didn't ever want to have kids in the first place but shit happens I guess. I love being a mom, I love my son to death. I know there is a possibility one day I'll change my mind, and I accept that, but I don't want my husband to bank on that happening. \n\nSo WIBTA if I remained adamant in my convictions to never have another kid for my husband's sake?",
        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a really tough situation, and it's understandable to feel conflicted about it. It's important to communicate openly with your husband about your feelings and concerns. You have valid reasons for not wanting another child, and it's crucial that both of you feel heard and understood in this discussion.\n\nUltimately, the decision about whether or not to have another child should be mutual and based on what both of you truly want. If you feel strongly that you do not want another child, it's important to stand by that conviction. Forcing yourself to have another child out of obligation or guilt is not a healthy approach for either of you.\n\nConsider seeking counseling or therapy, either individually or as a couple, to help navigate this conversation and explore your feelings further.

We divorced, and I let my ex-wife take full custody and move into the neighboring state (I regret this now but lacked resources to fight). I visited when I could and when Jessica was old enough she would come to visit for her summer breaks.\n\nEventually I met my current wife, a wonderful woman who had no problems at all with Jessica visiting. We fell in love and we even had Jessica fly in to be the flower girl at our wedding. She was very happy for us and all was well.\n\nMy wife fell pregnant soon after and we realized that her due date would fall in July, right in the middle of Jessica\u2019s usual visitation. We contacted my ex wife and explained that my wife would be due during the visit and we would not be able to care for Jessica, but she would be welcome to visit for Spring Break.\n\nMy ex exploded (we were fairly civil before this) and demanded that we make accommodations, like having my brother and his wife take in Jessica while my wife labored. I explained that labor wasn\u2019t the only concern, because my wife would be dealing with hormones and learning to be a mom, and I would have to return to work quickly so it would be all on my wife.\n\nWhen Jessica visited next, she asked me why she couldn\u2019t visit before, and if I would send away her baby sister when I eventually have a second. I told her that we did the best we could.\n\nThe next year my ex wife told me that Jessica wanted to stay home to focus on her studies. She never came back for another summer, instead visiting briefly around the holidays, and not even every year. She has been much colder, and I think my ex has had a large role in that.\n\nIn my mind we were simply being realistic. It wouldn\u2019t have been fair to Jessica to be here in the chaos of a new baby, and it wouldn\u2019t have been fair to my wife to make her care for a child that wasn\u2019t hers when she was so vulnerable. In literally all other cases she treated Jessica like one of her own. Likewise, at the time my brother was a flake, so leaving her with them was not an option.\n\nI ask this now because Jessica just turned 18. I called her up and asked if we could put the past behind us and begin again, as adults. She said she had no interest in making a relationship with someone who wasn\u2019t even family to her.\n\nI told her she was malicious and that she has chosen to hold a grudge for years. I said I would never be able to be worthy to her, and that I was done going through that pain. If she wanted a relationship I would be there, but I wouldn\u2019t force it.\n\nMy brother says that I\u2019m being a jerk and that Jessica\u2019s in pain\u2014 and I get that, I really do, but she is the one who has chosen not to move past it. AITA?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you made a decision based on the circumstances surrounding your wife's pregnancy and the challenges of caring for a child during that time. You communicated with your ex-wife about the situation and offered an alternative visitation during Spring Break, which shows that you were trying to be reasonable.\n\nHowever, it appears that the fallout from this decision has had lasting effects on your relationship with Jessica. It's understandable that she may feel hurt or abandoned, especially if she perceives that her needs were not prioritized during that time. Your ex-wife's reaction and Jessica's subsequent distance may have contributed to this perception.\n\nIt's important to recognize that while you may have acted in what you believed was the best interest of everyone involved, the emotional impact on Jessica cannot be overlooked. Her feelings of resentment and hurt are valid, and it may take time and effort to rebuild that relationship.\n\nIn this case, it might be beneficial to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. Acknowledging Jessica's feelings and expressing a genuine desire to reconnect may help mend the relationship. It may also be helpful to seek professional guidance, such as family counseling, to facilitate communication and healing.\n\nUltimately, while you may not be the \"jerk\" in this situation, it is clear that there are unresolved feelings and pain that need to be addressed. Open and honest communication, along with a willingness to listen and understand Jessica's perspective, will be key in moving forward.",

Her sister, niece, father and I all have birthdays in August within a week of each other so usually one big party is thrown for us and we all open gifts.\n\nNow I\u2019m in a weird spot in my life. I\u2019ll be turning 24 this Friday. I just moved into my first apartment with my boyfriend and am still adjusting to spending this much money on rent/utilities. I\u2019m paying of A LOT of credit card/student debt that accumulated from a lot of circumstances, but now that I have my first decently paying job, I\u2019ve been making progress paying it off and I\u2019m really proud of myself. However money is still a little tight for me.\n\nKnowing this I asked my stepmom if I could contribute a little bit to a gift for everyone together because I didn\u2019t feel I could afford to get everyone something. She said not to worry, she would put my name on what she got them and it would be a \u201cfamily gift.\u201d And that was the end of it.\n\nI have been saving a little money but after the party I ended up spending a pretty decent chunk of change ($100) on a high end pillow because I have neck/back problems and keep waking up unable to move my neck. I also spend money ($64) on skincare stuff because my skin is really sensitive and I was having a hard time finding cheap stuff that worked for me.\n\nI feel really guilty spending the money I saved on myself and not buying birthday presents for my family members. My cousin is planning her wedding in Cancun for next year, which I know is expensive for her and she\u2019s on a budget and she still bought everyone something. AITA for doing this?

Her sister, niece, father and I all have birthdays in August within a week of each other so usually one big party is thrown for us and we all open gifts.\n\nNow I\u2019m in a weird spot in my life. I\u2019ll be turning 24 this Friday. I just moved into my first apartment with my boyfriend and am still adjusting to spending this much money on rent/utilities. I\u2019m paying of A LOT of credit card/student debt that accumulated from a lot of circumstances, but now that I have my first decently paying job, I\u2019ve been making progress paying it off and I\u2019m really proud of myself. However money is still a little tight for me.\n\nKnowing this I asked my stepmom if I could contribute a little bit to a gift for everyone together because I didn\u2019t feel I could afford to get everyone something. She said not to worry, she would put my name on what she got them and it would be a \u201cfamily gift.\u201d And that was the end of it.\n\nI have been saving a little money but after the party I ended up spending a pretty decent chunk of change ($100) on a high end pillow because I have neck/back problems and keep waking up unable to move my neck. I also spend money ($64) on skincare stuff because my skin is really sensitive and I was having a hard time finding cheap stuff that worked for me.\n\nI feel really guilty spending the money I saved on myself and not buying birthday presents for my family members. My cousin is planning her wedding in Cancun for next year, which I know is expensive for her and she\u2019s on a budget and she still bought everyone something. AITA for doing this?

Half a year later and my family still won\u2019t stop giving me grief for this, so here goes.\n\nI (28M) was pretty surprised when word got around that Shirley and Brian (mid 20s M) were having a big wedding, about 200 people. Shirley\u2019s family isn\u2019t well-off (my mom has helped my aunt and uncle out with car expenses and stuff like that over the years). I don\u2019t know what Brian and his parents do.\n\nWhen the invitation arrived, I saw a line on the bottom asking that we bring a dish to pass. I was a little irritated because money was tight and I have a very small kitchen that\u2019s not suited for cooking for more than 4 or 6 people. I had also already sent them a gift off the registry that they linked to on the wedding website that had already been up for awhile.\n\nI have a \u201cfamous\u201d in my family moussaka that I make for special occasions. It\u2019s delicious, but it takes me awhile to prepare, and the cost of the ingredients really add up. When I called to RSVP, Shirley said she was hoping I would make about three or four 9x13 pans of it. (I don\u2019t even have one 9x13 pan at home.)\n\nI was pretty honest with Shirley and told her my situation, but offered to pick up a party tray at BJ\u2019s. She sounded really hurt and said she wanted the reception to be a chance to share family recipes (combining the two families and all that), and this would count as my wedding gift. The wedding was a couple hours away where Brian\u2019s family lives, so transporting it would be difficult, but Shirley said \u201cnobody will care if it gets a little cold\u201d.\n\nShirley said if I can\u2019t bring the moussaka, then I should make another savory dish, \u201csomething cheesy\u201d. And be sure to bring three pans of it.\n\nI talked to my sister and I guess Shirley gave her the same speech. My sister said she was going to bring a veggie tray anyways. My mom and my brother, meanwhile, spent the night before slaving over multiple lasagnas. \n\nI ended up injuring my foot a couple weeks before the wedding. Feeling overwhelmed, I decided to keep things simple. Everyone in the family loves Kraft mac and cheese. So I got three foil pans and I made several boxes. I doctored it up with some parmesan and herbs I had at home and some bread crumbs on top.\n\nWhen I got to the wedding and finished bringing all the mac and cheese from my car to the tables, I saw my uncle, who was setting up too, and he gave me a dirty look. \n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything but later it got out that Shirley and Brian were *livid* about the mac and cheese.\n\nMy family is kind of divided on it. My sister thinks that\u2019s what Shirley and Brian get for asking people to bring food, but my mom thinks that I was being petty and I should\u2019ve just sucked it up.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that the intent behind bringing Kraft mac and cheese to a wedding potluck was not well-received. While you may have thought it was a simple and beloved dish, it appears that it did not align with the expectations of the occasion, especially given that the couple wanted to share family recipes and meaningful dishes. \n\nYour cousin Shirley expressed a desire for guests to contribute dishes that held significance, and it seems that the mac and cheese did not meet that standard. While you were dealing with personal challenges, including an injury and limited resources, it might have been better to communicate more openly with Shirley about your situation or to seek an alternative dish that would have been more appropriate for the occasion.\n\nIn summary, while you may have had good intentions, the choice of dish was not suitable for a wedding reception, and it would be reasonable to say that you were in the wrong in this instance.",

(I don\u2019t even have one 9x13 pan at home.)\n\nI was pretty honest with Shirley and told her my situation, but offered to pick up a party tray at BJ\u2019s. She sounded really hurt and said she wanted the reception to be a chance to share family recipes (combining the two families and all that), and this would count as my wedding gift. The wedding was a couple hours away where Brian\u2019s family lives, so transporting it would be difficult, but Shirley said \u201cnobody will care if it gets a little cold\u201d.\n\nShirley said if I can\u2019t bring the moussaka, then I should make another savory dish, \u201csomething cheesy\u201d. And be sure to bring three pans of it.\n\nI talked to my sister and I guess Shirley gave her the same speech. My sister said she was going to bring a veggie tray anyways. My mom and my brother, meanwhile, spent the night before slaving over multiple lasagnas. \n\nI ended up injuring my foot a couple weeks before the wedding. Feeling overwhelmed, I decided to keep things simple. Everyone in the family loves Kraft mac and cheese. So I got three foil pans and I made several boxes. I doctored it up with some parmesan and herbs I had at home and some bread crumbs on top.\n\nWhen I got to the wedding and finished bringing all the mac and cheese from my car to the tables, I saw my uncle, who was setting up too, and he gave me a dirty look. \n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything but later it got out that Shirley and Brian were *livid* about the mac and cheese.\n\nMy family is kind of divided on it. My sister thinks that\u2019s what Shirley and Brian get for asking people to bring food, but my mom thinks that I was being petty and I should\u2019ve just sucked it up.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Sorry if I don't format correctly etc. Background: I was on a dating site for about 2 years from late 2014 until Oct 2016. I didn't meet a lot of people, several creeps, a few non starters, but October of 2016 I met my now husband and we have been married for 2 years last November. \n\nSome time mid 2016 I started chatting to a guy (let's call him Tom) on the site, it was friendly but a bit lacklustre- he would only get back to me once every week or two, and he lived in a different state. We never spoke on the phone, I once mentioned that I have an art website he should check out some time. I didnt feel like he seemed super keen and I was in it to actually find a partner, so I just let it fizzle. Realistically, I guess I stopped replying, but don't honestly remember now. And around that time I met my now husband on the same site, so I think I ghosted Tom, felt a bit bad but not too bad, and discontinued my membership completely by the end of that year.\n\nTonight, I receive a phone call from a number I'm not familiar with, and I answer it to hear a stranger introduce himself. He tells me that his name is Tom, he knows me from the dating website, and says 'we seem to have lost touch', and that he found my mobile number on my art website that I told him to look at in 2016. I responded with something like 'Tom? I can't remember a Tom?' (The truth! It was a handful of emails 3.5 years ago) and 'um, I'm really sorry but I'm married now.' He kept going with how he'd like to resume contact, and about how he had got my number. I am on the other end both assuming that he wants to pick up where we left off and feeling creeped out that this guy is calling my phone after more than 3 years of no contact and not actually having been given my number. I remind him again that I am married now, apologize again and say good bye. End convo, my husband and I laugh about it and move on. \n\n30 min later I receive a lengthy message from Tom, simultaneously rebuking me for how rude I just was on the phone (\"I was very offended at how you treated me before\", \"I always assumed you got married, you seemed to always want to\", \"please dont reply and be as rude as you were before\" and,\" males and females can be just friends you know\") and asking me how I'm going, telling me how he is etc. I guess I was rude in retrospect, but I don't know this dude and why would he call me out of the blue after three years on a number he had to dig up from internet past?\n\nAgainst my normal nature, instead of replying and apologising for hurting his feelings, and chatting to him like I used to, I blocked his number.

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're trying to understand your girlfriend's perspective and communicate openly, which is a positive intention. However, it's important to respect her boundaries and understand that sometimes people may not want to explain their reasons for declining something. Insisting on a reason can come off as dismissive of her feelings or autonomy. \n\nIn this case, it might be helpful to have a conversation with her about how you both communicate and express your preferences. You could explain that you value her input and want to understand her choices, but also be open to accepting her decisions without needing an explanation. \n\nSo, to answer your question: \"AITA for always insisting on a reason from my gf or family member when they decline something?\" - \"NTA\" for wanting to understand, but \"A\" for not respecting her boundaries.",

She was going outside from a parking hall that was really empty and it was pretty late, so she had to wait a while (almost an hour) before some people came to help her out. \n\nEver since then she's been very scared to take elevators and takes the stairs instead anytime she can. I think that's ridiculous, because it's been a long time since she got stuck and she wasn't even stuck for that long. I think it's annoying and stupid to use the stairs and make others wait. \n\nLast night we were all going to a restaurant to celebrate our dad's 50th birthday. We parked in a parking hall headed to the elevator. She said she's taking the stairs and I said \"You know it's so annoying when we have to wait for you.\" And she said \"it's not for long, we're only 4 floors down.\" And then I kind of raised my voice and said something along the lines of \"If it's such a short time why can't you take the elevator? You act like you have PTSD just get over yourself.\" \n\nShe then called me an idiot and went to the staircase. In the elevator my parents said I was being mean and not to talk like that again. I think I was justified because she's basically an adult and being such a coward it's getting on my nerves. \n\nSo what do you think Reddit, am I the Asshole for standing up for us all and telling my sister how things are?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you were frustrated with your sister's fear of elevators, especially since it was affecting the group's ability to enjoy the celebration. However, it's important to recognize that her fear is valid, especially considering her past experience of being stuck in an elevator. \n\nInstead of expressing your frustration in a harsh way, it might have been more constructive to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. You could have acknowledged her fear and offered support rather than dismissing it as \"stupid.\" \n\nGiven that your parents also felt you were being mean, it suggests that your approach was not well-received. In this case, it would be more appropriate to apologize to your sister for your harsh words and try to understand her perspective. \n\nSo, in this instance, it seems you may have acted in a way that could be perceived as inconsiderate, and it would be best to reflect on how to communicate more kindly in the future.",

Your concerns about Matt's intentions and the nature of their relationship are valid, particularly since there have been instances that raise red flags for you, such as Matt's jealousy and past behavior.\n\nHowever, it's important to communicate your feelings to your boyfriend openly and honestly. Instead of demanding he distance himself from Matt, consider discussing your concerns and how they make you feel. This way, you can both explore the dynamics of their friendship together and find a resolution that respects both your feelings and your boyfriend's long-standing friendship.\n\nUltimately, it's about trust and communication in your relationship. If your boyfriend values your feelings, he will be willing to listen and address your concerns.",

While it's important to approach this situation with empathy, it's also crucial to prioritize your own well-being and comfort in your living space.\n\nYou might consider having a calm and respectful conversation with Kate about how her actions are affecting you and the other roommates. Express your concerns without being accusatory, and see if she's willing to discuss her situation. It's possible that she may not even realize how disruptive it is for everyone else.\n\nIf she is unwilling to change her behavior or seek help, it may be necessary to set boundaries regarding the shared bathroom. You and your roommates deserve to feel comfortable in your home, and it's okay to advocate for that.\n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance between compassion for Kate and ensuring that your living environment is healthy and respectful for everyone involved.",

While you may have had good intentions in wanting to maintain a certain level of appropriateness for the event, the way you communicated your feelings led to a breakdown in your friendship and the group dynamic.\n\nIt's important to remember that everyone has different comfort levels and perspectives on what is appropriate attire, especially in a festival setting. Your friend's choice to dress in a way that you found inappropriate may not have been intended to offend, and your reaction may have come off as judgmental to her and the others in your group.\n\nIn this case, it might be best to reflect on how you approached the situation and consider that your feelings were valid, but the way you expressed them may have been perceived as harsh. It could be beneficial to have an open conversation with your friends about boundaries and comfort levels in the future, but for now, it seems that the situation has escalated to a point where it may be best to take a step back and reassess the friendships involved.\n\nOverall, while you may not have intended to be an \"asshole,\" the way the situation unfolded suggests that there was a miscommunication and misunderstanding that led to hurt feelings on both sides.",

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a tough situation. It's understandable to feel conflicted about whether to tell your future sister-in-law about your brother's past infidelity. However, it's important to consider the potential consequences of your actions.\n\n1. **Impact on Relationships**: Exposing your brother's past could severely damage your relationship with him. It might also affect your relationship with your future sister-in-law, especially if she feels betrayed or hurt by the revelation.\n\n2. **Motivation**: It seems like your motivation for wanting to tell her stems from your dislike for her and the changes you've seen in your brother. However, it's crucial to reflect on whether your feelings are valid reasons to intervene in their relationship.\n\n3. **Current Relationship**: If your brother and his girlfriend have built a healthy relationship since the cheating incident, it might be best to let the past stay in the past. People can change, and your brother may have learned from his mistakes.\n\n4. **Communication**: Instead of exposing your brother, consider having an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns regarding his relationship and how it has affected your bond. This approach may lead to a more constructive outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, it would likely be best not to tell your future sister-in-law about your brother's past infidelity. Instead, focus on maintaining your relationship with your brother and addressing your concerns directly with him.",

For about a year she had a boyfriend and seemed to be  happy. At some point she met another guy. They got close pretty fast, but she said that they are just friends. After some time she told me that she thinks she is poly. She was afraid that I would hate her. I told her that I don't have a problem with that. As long as she is happy, I am happy for her. She said that she is in love with her boyfriend and the new guy friend. She wants therefore an open relationship, but is afraid how her boyfriend will react if she asks him. I encouraged her to talk to him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple of days later she talked with him and that he wasn't sure if he would be ok with an open relationship. He wanted some time to think about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next day he calls her and says that he can't do it. He breaks up with her, but wishes her the best. She immediately calls me and is freaking out. She says she is in shock that he broke up. She never would have seen it coming that he would just break up. I am confused and say that I am not so shocked, because he already said yesterday that he isn't sure. She calls me heartless bitch and that she definitly never thought that he would break up. She also claims to have a heart attack. I tell her that she probably has a Panic attack and to take some Deep breaths to calm down. She doesn't listen to it and rants on About how ruthless her now ex boyfriend is until she suddenly hangs up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't really know what to do after that. I didn't contact her to not upset her. She texted me a couple of days later:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer: i am still upset that you haven't apologized yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: i don't really know what to apologize for. I stand by what i said. It was not a sudden shock to you. You knew before that he could break up. He even said that he wasn't sure. But i understand that the timing wasn't right for me to say that. So i apologize for saying that straight away when you were very emotional. I should have talked to you about that at a later point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer: that's not what you did wrong. It was a sudden break up. I didn't know that he would even consider breaking up. I could have never guessed that! Why are you in his side?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: that is just not the truth. When you told me that you are poly you said you were worried how he would react. And when you told him, he said he needs time to think about it. To me it was pretty clear that he could break up with you. And to be honest, i can understand him. Apparently he doesn't want an open relationship and so he rather breaks it up with you than to keep a relationship going that would make both of you unhappy. Maybe it is better that way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer: wow.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you were trying to be honest with your friend about the situation and express your understanding of her ex-boyfriend's perspective. However, your friend was in a very emotional state, and your comments may have come off as unsupportive or dismissive of her feelings. \n\nWhile you may not have intended to hurt her, it\u2019s important to recognize that she was looking for comfort and support during a difficult time. Instead of focusing on the reasons for the breakup, it might have been more helpful to listen to her feelings and provide emotional support. \n\nIn this case, it seems that your friend felt hurt and misunderstood, which led to her calling you names. It might be beneficial to reach out to her again, apologize for not being more supportive, and let her know that you care about her feelings. \n\nSo, while you may not be an \"asshole\" in the traditional sense, it seems that your approach could have been more empathetic.",

I love to cook and bake anyway and this is my first time getting to work in a job that allows me to do that. I've been making things like coffee cake and banana bread and muffins at home on my own time specifically for the staff to munch on throughout the day because everyone has been really welcoming and feeding people is how I show affection. \n\nHere's the thing-there's a couple staff members with dietary restrictions. One woman has a soy allergy. One has an egg and nut allergy. One is very diabetic. So I've been modifying all my recipes to accommodate them. Today, I was talking to my boss and telling her about the banana bread I brought in this morning-how I had replaced the eggs and sugar without sacrificing the flavor. The woman with diabetes, \"Ann\", must have been right outside the kitchen when I was talking about how I had replaced the sugar and she LOST. HER. SHIT. She started yelling that I must have invaded her privacy to find out she was diabetic and that making things sugar free without talking to her was me \"policing her body\". Flabbergasted, I tried to explain that, as the person making all the food, I have to know *everyone's* food restrictions, both kids and staff. She then called the other 2 staff with food restrictions in to \"expose\" what I had done. The other 2 women said they were already aware that I knew about their restrictions and were grateful that I went out of my way to accommodate them. Ann continued ranting about me policing her and said I was \"shaming\" her. I hate confrontation and when I'm being yelled at, I implode and start crying. My boss was standing right there the whole time trying to help me explain to Ann and, when I started crying, she told Ann to stop screaming and take the rest of the day off. Ann left, but she was messaging and texting the rest of the staff about how horrible I had made her feel. Now the staff is divided-about half think I did nothing wrong and the other half think I should have talked to her and asked if she wanted me to make things sugar free because she's very sensitive about her diabetes being primarily caused by her weight. They also think it's my fault she got sent home, that I was \"overdramaric\" and \"trying to make Ann look bad\" by crying and that I'm an ass because being sent home will be a strike in her file.

You made an effort to ensure that everyone could enjoy the food you prepared, which is commendable. However, it appears that Ann felt uncomfortable with the way you handled the situation, leading to her outburst.\n\nIn this case, while your intentions were good, it might have been better to communicate with Ann beforehand about her preferences regarding sugar-free options. This could have prevented her from feeling \"policed\" and \"shamed.\" \n\nUltimately, it seems like a misunderstanding rather than a malicious act on your part. Therefore, I would say you are not the asshole in this situation, but it might be a good idea to have a conversation with Ann to clear the air and ensure that everyone feels comfortable in the future.",

It might be helpful to express your feelings to her and explain why this situation upset you. It's important for both of you to understand each other's boundaries and to respect them.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it sounds like you have been more than patient with your roommate regarding a very disrespectful behavior. It's understandable to feel frustrated after repeatedly asking him to clean up after himself, especially when it affects your living environment. While yelling may not have been the best approach, your feelings of anger and frustration are valid. \n\nIt seems like your roommate has not taken your requests seriously, and it's reasonable to expect basic cleanliness in shared spaces. However, it might be helpful to have a calm conversation with him about the issue again, expressing how it affects you and your living situation. If he continues to disregard your requests, it may be worth considering whether this living arrangement is sustainable for you. \n\nIn summary, while you may not have handled the situation perfectly, your frustration is understandable, and you are not the asshole for wanting a clean living space.",

I planned my games so they didn\u2019t land on a school night, because that would be fairy stressful in university. \n\nSo around 3 days before, my brother, 26 years old, demanded one night that he gets the tickets I had scheduled in. I had made plans and invited a friend to the game, so naturally I said no. My mom was a bit mad at this, and wanted me to switch, but I wouldn\u2019t budge. \n\nMy brother came from Vancouver for a couple months and is leaving in December, so he will be going to MANY games while he\u2019s here (he\u2019s already been to a couple in the first couple weeks here). Anyway it\u2019s his favourite team playing this night. \n\nMy mom ended up spending 300$ on tickets for him and his friends to go to the game, but I didn\u2019t really care as long as my seats weren\u2019t altered (I had better seats, he is in the upper deck). Everything was fine\n\nThe night of the game me and my friend are watching, having a really good time, and my mom texts me.

My sister has always been the favourite child, and is defended by my mother in all situations no matter how wrong she may be. My sister has been financially supported by our parents her whole life, and is currently the reason my father is unable to retire. I have very little respect for her. Despite this situation, I have made every effort to treat her well whenever we interact and I make sure I am not to blame for any breakdowns in the family.\n\nSince moving home a month and a half ago, my sister has been consistently antisocial and hostile towards me. In itself, that's fine, but she then runs to my mother, in private, to spin the story around and make me a problem. My mother then comes to me to give me a stern talking to, which significantly strains my relationship with my parents. Some examples include:\n\n\\- My sister said she wanted an Xbox controller to play a game. I had a controller lying around and told hr she is welcome to borrow it, but she declined (for whatever reason). A few days later she demands the controller immediately, except I am working (remotely) and do not want to look for it now. She ran to my mother to tell her I was demanding money for the controller (make her buy it) and would not lend it to her.\n\n\\- I was making coffee in the kitchen recently. My sister comes in and aggressively asks me when it's her turn, then leaves. She was in there all of 10 seconds and told my mother I was preventing her using the kitchen 'for ages'.\n\nI think my sister's lying, followed by my mother's validation is her way of coping with her own behaviour, which is probably easier than learning to co-exist with people. Anyway, I got tired of this cycle of bullshit and sent my sister a private message that read:\n\n\\> Stop lying about me to Mum and/or Dad. Lie about your work all you want, I don't care, but I am done with you repeatedly justifying your antisocial behaviour by lying when it involves me.\n\nThe work part relates to her lying to my parents about getting a job, which I witness consistently and hold my tongue on. When she got this message, she went to Mum and Dad and they lost their shit at me. Mum told me if I ever pull such a 'threatening stunt' again, I am to pack my shit and leave immediately. I thought I was 100% in the right, but for the first time my father is wholeheartedly siding with the rest of the family which makes me doubt myself.\n\nSo Reddit, in sending that message, am I the asshole here? How should I have handled it?",
        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a really tough situation with your sister and your family. From what you've described, it seems like your sister is not being honest about your interactions, which is understandably frustrating for you. However, sending a message like that can escalate tensions and lead to misunderstandings, especially since it seems to have resulted in a backlash from your parents.\n\nIn this case, it might be more constructive to try to address the situation directly with your sister in a calm and open manner, rather than resorting to messages that could be perceived as confrontational. It could help to express how her actions are affecting you and your relationship with your parents, and to ask her to communicate more honestly about her feelings.\n\nUltimately, while you may feel justified in your frustration, the way you approached the situation may not have been the best choice. It might be worth considering how to improve communication and resolve conflicts in a more positive way moving forward.",

The normal candy-hander-outer is my Mother because she can tolerate children more than the rest of us, but she was working late because of <insert work problem here> so I manned the fort while she was gone. \n\nThe night was quiet overall, not many kids and the ones that did come were nice and most importantly had cool costumes. Well about 10 minutes before my Mom got home there, was a singular ring of the doorbell. No problem, I stand up and go to the door. In about the 30 seconds it took me to stand up and get to the door it had rung (not even exaggerating) about 35-50 more times. Whoever was spamming this doorbell had Starcraft Grandmaster level APM. Of course by now I'm mad. Asking for free candy is fine one night a year but this is just rude. I swing the door open and see 3 kids, all about 7-8 years old, one of which is still pressing the doorbell. These kids had no parents, no supervisors, no costumes (literally just a witch hat on two of them and a zombie mask on the other one.) Pissed off, I say \"You rang the doorbell too many times. Go away\" and accept anything that comes from the blowback, a TP attack, an egging, whatever. These kids are not getting candy, fuck them. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later, my Mom is finally home when the doorbell rings again. What do you know Starcraft APM girl is back at it. My Mom opens the door and about 10 seven year olds (likely after my head) and they were asking for candy, again. My Mom is a much more patient person than so she hands them candy. Afters, zombie mask kid takes off his mask and says \"Bring that guy out here I have a few words for him.\" (Respectfully, I declined)  \n\nSo I guess one question remains, AITA for not giving these clearly rude kids candy on Halloween? This has divided my friend group and I for about the past 2-3 hours so I'll let you guys decide. \n\ntldr: Refused to give kids Halloween candy because they mashed our doorbell repeatedly for candy.

I hope you understand my perspective.\" \n\nIt's important to be respectful and considerate in your approach, and hopefully, your cousins will understand your feelings.

She said that my height was \u201cdistracting\u201d and she was afraid that I\u2019d block the view of those sitting in the back rows (my BF and I were sitting somewhere in the middle). I thought it was an odd request because my BF is next to me and he\u2019s half a foot taller than me...should he crouch down? But I didn\u2019t want to argue with the mother of the bride.

Given that you were dressed appropriately for the occasion and that many other guests were also wearing heels, it seems unreasonable for her to ask you to remove them. \n\nYou were polite and respectful throughout the event, and it is not your fault that you are tall. Height is something you cannot control, and wearing heels is a common practice at formal events. \n\nIn conclusion, you are not the one at fault here. The mother of the bride's request seems to stem from her own insecurities rather than any real issue with your attire. You should feel confident in your choice to wear heels, especially since you were following the dress code and were not being disruptive.",

Communication is key in understanding each other's perspectives and finding a way to move forward. \n\nIn conclusion, while you may not be the \"asshole\" in this specific incident, it would be beneficial to address the underlying issues in your relationship regarding respect for each other's possessions.",

The drone is cheap (< $100) and we already own a DJI drone, so he probably intended on regifting this free drone he got.  \n\nAs I was carrying it out of the car for him, all the contents in the box fell out while I carried it by the handle.  The box is crappy, the cover was closed by tape and the tape had lost all adhesive so it was worthless.  I was carrying a ticking time bomb like Kevin Durant's achilles's tendon and everything came crashing out.  \n\nWhen it happened, I automatically played it off as not my fault, the box was crappy and disregarded it since it was a) cheap and b) free.  My husband immediately proceeds to flip his shit because of how I responded to dropping the drone, not the fact that I dropped the drone.  He says I did not treat his property with any care, respect, and did not own up to my mistakes whether he paid for the drone, gifted the drone, or won it for free.  He says I do this all the time with his other possessions, not treating his stuff with the proper care and respect.\n\nI apologized for dropping it but defended my myself by saying the box was crappy.\n\nAITA?",

However, it's important to consider the dynamics of your blended family and the potential impact of excluding her from the vacation.\n\nWhile your feelings are valid, it may be more constructive to address the issue directly with your stepdaughter rather than excluding her from the trip. Open communication about how her taunting affected your children could help resolve the underlying tension. It might also be beneficial to involve your husband in this conversation to find a solution that works for everyone.\n\nUltimately, it may not be fair to exclude your stepdaughter from the vacation, as it could create further division within the family. Instead, consider discussing boundaries and expectations for behavior during the trip to ensure a more positive experience for everyone involved.",

On doctors orders I'm not even allowed on a plane because of it, I'll get massive nosebleeds etc. Long story short, it's a medical need for me and my BF knows that. \n\nWell, about 20 minutes into our trip I asked his family member if I could roll the window down because I was getting a headache (it's their car). They refused, but turned the AC on as a \"compromise\". That's not a compromise to me because it doesn't help me at all. \n\nI spend the whole 6 hours feeling sick and miserable.

The driver hurriedly rolled the windows down, my BF was disgusted, but I could finally relax in the car ride because my head wasn't killing me.

First wife moved and lives in another state with the kids, all teens now.\n\nWe met three and a half years ago, a year after my separation from my wife, before the divorce. I made it amicable for the sake of the kids and not spending a lot on lawyers, but except where the kids are concerned, I have no relationship with the Ex.  That being said, the two ladies do NOT get along, but more ice than fire.  I generally try to maintain detente for the sake of not traumatizing the kids when all of us are together.  I proposed to New Wife this last February while I was stationed in the Middle East (she was visiting) and we married in July (while I was on leave home). We finally moved into the same house this month. Well, combining households, I'm opening her boxes and she's opening mine, some I haven't seen since before I moved overseas, before I proposed.\n\nShe finds 4 tote-boxes of former family photos. Most all of which are of the kids growing up and me with the ex, but also some of me and the Ex's wedding 19.5 years ago, photos when we dated, photos from the vow renewal before the separation, some in frames, some still in the photo-mat sleeves. I took half the family pics when I moved out, and honestly, I have not looked at them hardly since. Never did I thumb threw them in some wistful haze, wishing I was still with old wife. I mostly took them for the sake of giving continuity to the kids, intending to eventually pass them along as part of the family record, momentos of when things were still good. But truthfully, I didn't think much about them.\n\nNew Wife was VERY upset. She understood (sort of) about the kid pix, and passing those along, but was taken aback by the volume of pix, and the fact that I had not excised the dating, wedding, or vow renewal pics at any time in the last 5 years. We had a fight/cry session and she's soaking In the tub, truly annoyed with me. I admit her feelings are valid, but I don't see there's anything to really be upset about. The past is past. We both had relationships and full lives prior to meeting. She excised everything post relationship, but then again, she wasn't married with kids. Me, I never thought about it anymore, never sought catharsis that way. Now, she's moody, somehow this makes me mad because this shouldn't be held against me, so we're both at odds.\n\nAm I the asshole?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that both you and your new wife have valid perspectives. You see the photos as a part of your family's history, especially for the sake of your children, while your wife feels uncomfortable with the presence of those memories from your previous marriage. \n\nIt's important to acknowledge that your wife may feel insecure or threatened by the existence of those photos, as they represent a time in your life that she wasn't a part of. While you view them as a way to preserve family history, she may interpret them as a reminder of your past relationship. \n\nCommunication is key here. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your wife about the significance of the photos to you and your intentions behind keeping them. You could also discuss the possibility of storing them in a way that makes her feel more comfortable, such as keeping them in a separate space or only displaying the family photos that include your children.\n\nUltimately, it's about finding a compromise that respects both your past and your present relationship. So, while you may not be an \"asshole,\" it's essential to address your wife's feelings and work together to find a solution.",

We've never been super close by any stretch of the imagination, but we've certainly been in the same friendship group. To be honest I've always found her...a lot. She's the type of person who will post on Facebook about feeling miserable and then say she doesn't want to talk about it when people ask. \n\nAnyway, about six months ago Mia and I discovered that we both suffer from the same mental health condition. I won't get specific so as not to reveal too many identifying details, but it's a pretty shitty condition which comes with a whole host of pretty intense symptoms. I went through hell with it in years past, but am dealing much better now. I believed she was too, and told her if she did ever wanna talk with someone who knew she could talk to me. She told me the same. \n\nHonestly, I regret telling her this. It feels like every day she's calling me with some new problem, usually crying on the phone for up to an hour. I get that our condition can make tiny things seem like catastrophes but the things she calls me and cries about are varied and endless. Anything from a fight with her parents, with whom she has a horrible relationship, to the supermarket having no milk left so she can't have any tea tonight. I feel like this would take a lot of energy and be draining even for a neurotypical person. With my condition, it's downright exhausting. Especially given she more often than not ghosts me if I try to talk to her about my own issues bc she doesn't have the energy to help me out that day. \n\nSo here's my situation. I've tried talking to Mia about maybe switching therapists/getting more therapy (I've used her current therapist myself in the past and honestly he's not great), but she insists this is working for her. She doesn't like to take medication, which I believe would help, but okay that's her decision. Point is, she doesn't really seem to be making any proactive steps to improve and I don't know if I can handle her at full-tilt any more. The issue is I'm kinda the only person apart from her therapist she can really talk to about mental health things. None of our other friends have the condition so, while sympathetic, can only help so much. As I mentioned she has a shitty relationship with her family and can't really talk to them about it. If I cut her off, I'm essentially taking away her one outlet in order to save my own mental health. I just feel like that's disgustingly selfish, and idk if it's worth it. WIBTA for doing this?",
        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a really tough situation. It's commendable that you've been there for Mia, but it's also important to prioritize your own mental health. If her constant calls and emotional needs are draining you, it's okay to set boundaries. You can still be supportive without being her sole outlet. \n\nConsider having an honest conversation with her about how you're feeling. You might suggest that she seek additional support from a therapist or a support group, which could help her process her feelings without relying solely on you. \n\nUltimately, it's not selfish to take care of yourself. If you feel that cutting off contact is the best option for your well-being, then it's a valid choice. Just remember to communicate your feelings with her, if you decide to do so.",

She's the type of person who will post on Facebook about feeling miserable and then say she doesn't want to talk about it when people ask. \n\nAnyway, about six months ago Mia and I discovered that we both suffer from the same mental health condition. I won't get specific so as not to reveal too many identifying details, but it's a pretty shitty condition which comes with a whole host of pretty intense symptoms. I went through hell with it in years past, but am dealing much better now. I believed she was too, and told her if she did ever wanna talk with someone who knew she could talk to me. She told me the same. \n\nHonestly, I regret telling her this. It feels like every day she's calling me with some new problem, usually crying on the phone for up to an hour. I get that our condition can make tiny things seem like catastrophes but the things she calls me and cries about are varied and endless. Anything from a fight with her parents, with whom she has a horrible relationship, to the supermarket having no milk left so she can't have any tea tonight. I feel like this would take a lot of energy and be draining even for a neurotypical person. With my condition, it's downright exhausting. Especially given she more often than not ghosts me if I try to talk to her about my own issues bc she doesn't have the energy to help me out that day. \n\nSo here's my situation. I've tried talking to Mia about maybe switching therapists/getting more therapy (I've used her current therapist myself in the past and honestly he's not great), but she insists this is working for her. She doesn't like to take medication, which I believe would help, but okay that's her decision. Point is, she doesn't really seem to be making any proactive steps to improve and I don't know if I can handle her at full-tilt any more. The issue is I'm kinda the only person apart from her therapist she can really talk to about mental health things. None of our other friends have the condition so, while sympathetic, can only help so much. As I mentioned she has a shitty relationship with her family and can't really talk to them about it. If I cut her off, I'm essentially taking away her one outlet in order to save my own mental health. I just feel like that's disgustingly selfish, and idk if it's worth it. WIBTA for doing this?",

It's understandable to feel this way, as it seems like a missed opportunity for a shared experience that you both had looked forward to. \n\nIn this situation, it's important to communicate your feelings to your boyfriend. Let him know how much it means to you to share these experiences together and how it feels when he goes without you, especially when it was something you both had planned. It's not unreasonable to want to prioritize your relationship and the plans you made together. \n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance between supporting each other's friendships and making time for your relationship. If he truly doesn't want to go, he should feel comfortable expressing that to his friend. If he does decide to go, it might be worth discussing how you can plan to do the escape room together in the future, so you both have something to look forward to.",

        "model_response": "Based on the context you've provided, it seems that you have valid reasons for your decision to cut your father out of your life and prevent him from seeing your children. His actions during a critical time for your family, including cheating on your mother while she was battling cancer and his overall lack of support and respect for her, demonstrate a significant breach of trust and responsibility. \n\nIt's understandable that you would want to protect your children from someone who has shown such disregard for family values and loyalty. Your feelings of anger and betrayal are completely justified, and it's important to prioritize the well-being of your family, especially your children.\n\nWhile some family members may choose to reconcile with him, that doesn't mean you have to follow suit. Everyone has different thresholds for forgiveness, and it's okay to set boundaries that you feel are necessary for your family's safety and emotional health. \n\nIn conclusion, you are not the asshole for wanting to keep your father away from your children given his past actions. You are prioritizing your family's well-being, and that is commendable.",
