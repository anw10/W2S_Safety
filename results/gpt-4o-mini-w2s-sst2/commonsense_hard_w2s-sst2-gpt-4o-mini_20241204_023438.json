I recently came to know that my daughter in law leaves the house every single day after my son gets home from work and makes him watch the kids and cook dinner by himself, then she comes back and eats the dinner my son made for her while she was out. Once in a while is fine. Every work day is not fine. I told my daughter in law directly that she is the one staying home, so she should be doing the cooking, cleaning, and child rearing, not dumping the kids off on my son at the first convenient moment. My daughter in law ROLLED HER EYES at me, right in my face, and told me this is why I'm divorced. Then she walked away and refused to speak to me and made my son kick me out.

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a difficult situation, and it's understandable to feel frustrated about your daughter-in-law's behavior. However, it's important to consider how you approached the situation and the impact of your words. While you may have had good intentions in wanting to support your son, confronting your daughter-in-law directly and criticizing her parenting choices may not have been the best approach. \n\nIn this case, it might be more constructive to have an open and respectful conversation with both your son and daughter-in-law about your concerns, rather than placing blame. Communication is key in family dynamics, and it's important to express your feelings without creating conflict. \n\nSo, while your feelings are valid, the way you expressed them may not have been the most effective. It might be worth reflecting on how to approach the situation differently in the future.",

It's important to recognize that the behaviors you dislike\u2014like chewing, burping, or playing music through the mic\u2014are not inherently tied to any race or culture. It might be helpful to reflect on your experiences and consider that individuals from all backgrounds can exhibit both positive and negative behaviors.\n\nIf you're finding yourself dismissing people based on their usernames or perceived cultural references, it may be worth examining why that is and how it affects your interactions.

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a challenging situation, and it's understandable that both you and your fianc\u00e9 have different perspectives on how to handle the truth about your daughter's biological parentage. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Honesty vs. Privacy**: You value honesty and want to be open about your daughter's origins, which is commendable. However, your fianc\u00e9 may feel that revealing the circumstances of conception could lead to judgment or unwanted scrutiny. It's important to find a balance between being honest and respecting her feelings.\n\n2. **Future Implications**: As you mentioned, if you plan to have more children in the future, the story could become complicated if you don't establish a clear narrative now. It's essential to think about how this will affect your family dynamics and your daughter's understanding of her identity as she grows up.\n\n3. **Support and Understanding**: Try to have an open conversation with your fianc\u00e9 about her feelings and fears. Understanding her perspective may help you both find common ground. It's crucial to approach this discussion with empathy and a willingness to listen.\n\n4. **Family and Friends**: Consider how your family and friends might react to the truth. If they are supportive and loving, they may be more understanding than you anticipate. \n\n5. **Counseling**: If the two of you are struggling to find a resolution, seeking the help of a counselor or therapist could provide a neutral space to discuss your feelings and concerns.\n\nUltimately, it's important to communicate openly with your fianc\u00e9 and work together to find a solution that respects both of your values and feelings.",

She also says it's because she wants attractive kids. |   I have a friend, Sarah, who has always wanted kids. She loves her niblings and always spoils them but recently she's had a 'baby craze' and wants her own. Except, she's not in a relationship. So it seems obvious right? If you want a kid but you're not married go get a sperm donor or adopt. She doesn't want to adopt because she wants the kids to be hers biologically. She also doesn't want a sperm donor because, in her words, she wants her kids to be attractive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  Here's for some reason where I come in. Yesterday she proposes to me that \\*I\\* should be the donor. She says it's better because she knows me and because I'm attractive (no, not a humble brag, we both have blue eyes and she wants the kid to have blue eyes too). I feel... uneasy about this for multiple reasons. First I don't think I can live w/ myself knowing the kid is biologically mine but I can't raise him. Also there is something about the whole \"I want my kid to be attractive/have blue eyes\" that strikes me wrong, it feels like eugenics honestly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  I tell her I'm not comfortable with donating my sperm and she completely FLIPPED, as in started hysterically crying and throwing anything she can reach at me. I think she expected me to agree. I went home and my brother said it would make her happy if she had my kid and I should've just sucked it up and donated since it won't affect me in any way. I just told him if he's so sympathetic he's practically a clone of me and can go donate his sperm. My friend is making me type this post right now because he doesn't know what to think. Am i the asshole for not donating sperm to my friend and denying her the right to have attractive kids? It's not like there's no other guys with blue eyes, jesus.",

It's a deeply personal decision, and you have every right to feel uncomfortable with the idea. Your concerns about not being able to raise the child and the implications of her wanting a donor based on physical attributes are valid. It's important to consider the emotional and ethical aspects of such a decision, and it's clear that you are not ready to take on that responsibility. Your friend may be upset, but that doesn't mean you are in the wrong for prioritizing your own feelings and boundaries.",

            "input": "AITA for not donating my sperm to my friend who wants to get pregnant and raise the child as a single mother? She also says it's because she wants attractive kids. |   I have a friend, Sarah, who has always wanted kids. She loves her niblings and always spoils them but recently she's had a 'baby craze' and wants her own. Except, she's not in a relationship. So it seems obvious right? If you want a kid but you're not married go get a sperm donor or adopt. She doesn't want to adopt because she wants the kids to be hers biologically. She also doesn't want a sperm donor because, in her words, she wants her kids to be attractive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  Here's for some reason where I come in. Yesterday she proposes to me that \\*I\\* should be the donor. She says it's better because she knows me and because I'm attractive (no, not a humble brag, we both have blue eyes and she wants the kid to have blue eyes too). I feel... uneasy about this for multiple reasons. First I don't think I can live w/ myself knowing the kid is biologically mine but I can't raise him. Also there is something about the whole \"I want my kid to be attractive/have blue eyes\" that strikes me wrong, it feels like eugenics honestly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  I tell her I'm not comfortable with donating my sperm and she completely FLIPPED, as in started hysterically crying and throwing anything she can reach at me. I think she expected me to agree. I went home and my brother said it would make her happy if she had my kid and I should've just sucked it up and donated since it won't affect me in any way. I just told him if he's so sympathetic he's practically a clone of me and can go donate his sperm. My friend is making me type this post right now because he doesn't know what to think. Am i the asshole for not donating sperm to my friend and denying her the right to have attractive kids? It's not like there's no other guys with blue eyes, jesus.",

My husband recently got offered a promotion RIGHT before our son was born. He works driving transport was offered to drive to a city that's 8 hours away, stay over night then come back the next day, thus meaning I will be home alone with both kids two nights a week. Today was his last day of leave and he ended up going into work in town. Last night my son WOULD NOT SLEEP! so I was running on very little sleep this morning when we got up. I put him in his swing and went to take care of me (take my meds, get something to eat, something to drink) and he starts crying, screaming his head off because he's hungry AGAIN I had JUST fed him. So in the middle of me getting breakfast I get a bottle ready and put it in the microwave, as it's warming up I grab the waffles from the freezer and a bunch of stuff falls out So I'm trying to get that back in while my kid is screaming and I forget about the bottle and end up making it to hot so now I'm running the bottle under cold water to cool it down. I get my waffles made, get the bottle and head to the living room I set my stuff down bring the bottle over and go to prop it up with a burp sheet, I normally don't do that but I needed the space in that moment. When I went to prop it up I stepped on my husbands shoe that for SOME REASON is in the middle of the living room and I almost fall. I get the bottle propped with the first sheet and go to grab a second one when I trip AGAIN on these fucking shoes. So I picked them up and to let out some of my anger I went to throw them at the closet door by the front door. Well one of them I threw and somehow hit the tv so I turn it on to see how bad it is and the left side of it was all lines so you couldn't see the screen. So I call my husband at work and I'm hardly able to get out what happened because I'm crying so hard. You could hear in his voice that he was LIVID!! but thankfully he didn't lose his shit on me. I spent the next 3 hours ugly crying and feeling awful. He ended up going and getting a new one but obviously he's still pissed. We've hardly talked today. To top it off, he makes a comment about how he didn't get to finish setting up his truck (he does his first over night trip tomorrow) so that made me feel better.. It made me start silently crying again because I feel like all he cares about is work, this whole week that he's been off he won't stop talking about this new route and how he's bored because he's not at work. I know I crossed a line when I threw the shoes but I was so overwhelmed and needed to let some anger out so I figured throwing some shoes at a wall would help but instead it ended with having a broken TV AITA?",

It was because of conflicting schedules and long distance. (He lives in London, I live in New York). The break up was 3 months ago. I\u2019m seeing another guy now. We\u2019ve been going out for a couple of weeks and just made it official. I currently live by myself in my apartment.\n\nTwo nights ago, I woke up to someone coming into my room. I turned on the lamp and realized it was my ex. He used the key I had given him prior to our breakup to come into my apartment. I was so mad at him and told him to leave. He explained that he had just arrived in the city and decided to come to my apartment so he could \u201ccheckup on me\u201d. I said he could have at least given me a heads up instead of literally breaking into my apartment at 1 am. He apologized saying that he had tried to call me but I wasnt answering. He asked if he could stay the night. I finally relented because he was all cold and tired. \n\nI let him shower and get changed. I told him to sleep on the couch but he complained it was too uncomfortable and said he wanted to sleep in my bed. I said that\u2019s not appropriate (nor healthy). But he snuck in and slept in my bed anyways. I was too tired to protest. So we technically slept in the same bed together. He cuddled me at one point but I pushed him off and told him if he tried anything I\u2019d knee him in the balls.\n\nWhen he awoke, he said he was hungry so I made breakfast for the both of us. After, he finally decided to leave. Before doing so he brought up the idea of \u201cus\u201d again and told me he still loved me. He said he knows I still love him too. He said he wants to isolate with me for the next few weeks, he can work from his laptop and that it will \u201cbe fun\u201d.\n\nI told him that I\u2019m still trying to get over him and that he\u2019s making it unnecessarily hard for the both of us. His voice broke and he said \u201cBut I really love you.\u201d Anyways after a few more minutes of back and forth, he finally left (and returned the apt key to me). Since then he\u2019s been texting me regularly but I\u2019ve been responding with 1 word answers.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were video calling the other day, and he asked me what had happened (because I didn\u2019t text him for a day). I told him I was deep cleaning my apartment. He asked why and I decided to be honest and told him the whole story of my ex coming in. My BF got extremely upset and said that I should have called 911 as soon as he broke into my apartment. I told him I wasn\u2019t going to call the cops on my ex, especially not with the whole situation going on, letting him go to jail would be dangerous.\n\nMy boyfriend says I violated his trust by letting my ex stay the night. I didn\u2019t tell him about the bed sharing part yet. I don\u2019t exactly feel like I had any other choice except to let my ex stay with me. AITA here?",
        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it seems that you were put in a difficult position when your ex broke into your apartment. While you did let him stay the night out of compassion, it was not an ideal situation, especially since you are now in a new relationship. \n\nYour boyfriend's feelings are valid, as he may feel betrayed or uncomfortable with the idea of you sharing a bed with your ex, regardless of the circumstances. It's understandable that you didn't want to escalate the situation by calling the police, but it would have been better to set clear boundaries with your ex from the start. \n\nIn this case, it seems that you may not have handled the situation in the best way, especially considering your current relationship. It might be worth having an open conversation with your boyfriend about what happened and how you can rebuild trust moving forward. \n\nSo, to answer your question: \"AITA?\" - Yes, you may have made a mistake by allowing your ex to stay the night, especially in your bed, but it was also a complicated situation. It's important to communicate with your boyfriend about it and work through any feelings of mistrust.",

He said he wants to isolate with me for the next few weeks, he can work from his laptop and that it will \u201cbe fun\u201d.\n\nI told him that I\u2019m still trying to get over him and that he\u2019s making it unnecessarily hard for the both of us. His voice broke and he said \u201cBut I really love you.\u201d Anyways after a few more minutes of back and forth, he finally left (and returned the apt key to me). Since then he\u2019s been texting me regularly but I\u2019ve been responding with 1 word answers.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were video calling the other day, and he asked me what had happened (because I didn\u2019t text him for a day). I told him I was deep cleaning my apartment. He asked why and I decided to be honest and told him the whole story of my ex coming in. My BF got extremely upset and said that I should have called 911 as soon as he broke into my apartment. I told him I wasn\u2019t going to call the cops on my ex, especially not with the whole situation going on, letting him go to jail would be dangerous.\n\nMy boyfriend says I violated his trust by letting my ex stay the night. I didn\u2019t tell him about the bed sharing part yet. I don\u2019t exactly feel like I had any other choice except to let my ex stay with me. AITA here?",

His adopted father died when he was young and both of my parents are deceased so our family is very small. DH has never wanted to know his birth parents. His adopted mom has always kind of talked down about them whenever the topic is brought up, and talks about adopting like she should receive an award for bringing him here. I was also adopted and nobody ever talked about our parents to us that way, even though my parents lost me over drugs and alcohol. Eventually I did track down both my birth parents though. Now deceased.\n\nA few months ago we had a scare with an auto-immune reaction and became concerned for our kids. The doctors asked about generic history. I later tell DH that he could know if he called the agency and started the process. He doesn't want to because they gave him up. The area was in a bad way and I try explaining that he doesn't know the exact reasons why and reiterated what the doctors said about genetic history. I said we won't be around forever and both of our families are shrinking, isn't it great there are more people out there maybe wanting to know us and our kids will have a big family again. He says if they gave him up they aren't anyone he wants his kids around.\n\nA few weeks ago I found his parents. For medical history and for them. They weren't allowed to have another child and knew adoption would at least be a chance for him instead of abortion. I didn't tell him. They understand why he's mad but they're grateful he's safe.\n\nThen one night he was going through our photos on the cloud and saw a picture of one of his relatives.\n\n\"Who's this?\"\n\"Oh, I think he kind of looks like you, don't you think?\"\nBitterly(I think he was jealous actually)\"that guy doesn't look anything like me\"\n\nLater I asked again if he would ever consider meeting his birth parents, and he flat out refused. I said I know you're hurt but maybe they're looking for you too. He said that's what they get for giving him away. So I stayed silent.\n\nThen yesterday he started to piece together the bit about the picture. I explained it was for our kids, and for him and for them to have closure about their child. I said as a parent now wouldn't you be heartbroken if anything came between you and your kids that you couldn't prevent. I didn't think it was right for his adopted mom to be dragging his birth parents the way she does. That she did a wonderful job raising him and doesn't need to stand over people in desperate situations to prove it. He left for his adopted mom's and neither of them will speak to me now, which sucks because he has all the money and the bank cards and the car and neither of them will pick up so that I can take care of the kids.\n\nI feel like his birth parents deserved to know that their son is safe, and that they have beautiful grandchildren. They are my children's family. They were already robbed of their family once.\n\nI know my husband isn't TA, but AITA?",

However, your husband has expressed a strong desire not to pursue that relationship, and it appears that this has caused a significant rift between you two.\n\nWhile your intentions were to provide a sense of closure and connection, it\u2019s important to respect your husband's feelings and boundaries regarding his birth parents. He may have unresolved feelings about being adopted and may not be ready to confront that part of his past. \n\nIn this case, it seems that you may not be the asshole, as you were trying to do something you believed was beneficial for your family. However, it\u2019s also crucial to communicate openly with your husband about his feelings and to approach the situation with sensitivity. It might be helpful to give him some space and time to process his emotions before trying to discuss it further.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s important to prioritize your husband's feelings and to work together to find a resolution that respects both his wishes and your intentions.",

I work at a restaurant that has a convenience store in the front of the building where we sell ice cream, merchandise, candy, etc., and I was manning it that day. A burly man walks in with an open cup and is spilling water droplets on the floor as he walks in. I greet him and he walks over, hands me change and says \"For a refill\" (we do cheap refills for those who bring in our large cups or yetis or the like). I say ok sure and start counting while he goes and fills his cup. The total price of a refill is 81\u00a2 after sales tax and he only gave 80\u00a2. \n\nI politely ask him for the last penny and he looks at me like I insulted his mother and says \"Uh, no. You're not getting that penny.\" I reply with \"Well sir I need that last penny or I can't let you leave.\" He starts going on about how he's a regular here and is close with some of the employees who have been here longer than I have. I've never seen this guy before in my life so why should I believe him at all? Not to mention the fact that he walked in like he owned the place. Finally he says \"Is (employee) here? I'll get you your damn penny.\"\n\n As he walks towards the actual restaurant, employee is walking towards the front. I hear them talking until I hear employee yell out \"THATONETUBAMAN! What are you doing?!\" And employee walks over and starts to scold me, saying \"You never should have been trained for store.\" and \"He's a regular here, I know him.\" I told employee \"I've never seen that man in my life.\" To which employee responds \"Just because you've never seen him doesn't mean he isn't a regular.\" So apparently I'm not only supposed to believe every word each customer says but I'm also supposed to be omniscient while also not letting people steal stuff from the restaurant. \n\nIn my mind, if we let one person be short by a penny then we let everyone be short by a penny and pennies add up, especially at a popular restaurant like the one I work at. AITA?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you were following the rules and policies of the restaurant regarding transactions. While it may seem trivial to insist on a single penny, maintaining consistency in how transactions are handled is important for the integrity of the business. \n\nHowever, the way the situation escalated, especially with the employee scolding you, suggests that there may have been a lack of communication or understanding about the importance of enforcing the rules. It's also possible that the regular customer felt disrespected, which contributed to the conflict.\n\nIn this case, it might be helpful to consider the following points:\n\n1. **Policy Enforcement**: You were trying to uphold the policy of requiring the correct amount for a transaction. This is a reasonable stance, but it could have been handled differently.\n\n2. **Customer Relations**: The situation could have been diffused by explaining the policy more clearly or by offering a solution, such as allowing the customer to come back with the penny later.\n\n3. **Employee Support**: It\u2019s important for employees to support each other, especially in front of customers. The employee's reaction may have made you feel undermined.\n\n4. **Communication**: Clear communication with customers about policies can help prevent misunderstandings.\n\nIn conclusion, while you were not wrong to insist on the correct payment, the situation could have been handled with more tact and understanding. It\u2019s important to balance policy enforcement with customer service.",

That wasn't what I was trying to do, since I'm just here to seek other perspectives on this situation with my brother. Also I'm really sleep deprived and have just pulled two all-nighters in a row, so sorry if anything I said doesn't make sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm a sophomore at Wharton right now, and my brother Elliot, a junior, is making a list of colleges to apply to next year. What I've found out when I saw his list is that he has *really, really unrealistic expectations.* As in, he's applying to only prestigious universities- all the Ivies, Stanford, Northwestern, Berkeley, etc without applying to any safety schools- and simply does not have the resume to get into them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's what I mean. I'm not an expert on college applications by any means, but as someone who got into a decent amount of good-to-decent schools (Penn, Columbia, Princeton, UChicago, USC, Duke, Vandy, UVA, UCLA), know a lot of other people who got into good schools, and have talked to admission officers/read my admission files, I'd say I have a decent idea of what it takes to get into a good college. And that thing is essentially uniqueness- almost everybody applying to top schools has good grades, top test scores, leadership positions at clubs, etc. So if you apply to top schools with just good grades and leadership positions in a few clubs, you'll do absolutely nothing to differentiate yourself from 90% of the people applying- and at schools that reject 80%+ of the applicants, being forgettable is deadly, and pretty much a guaranteed rejection. To get in, you almost always have to do something unique that makes you stand apart from everyone else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, Elliot doesn't have anything to set himself apart- he's an impressive applicant by normal standards (4.5 GPA, 36 ACT, Captain of the Robotics team), but as I've already said, these stuff are not unique in any way shape or form. Almost everyone applying to these schools have these stats. Hell, I remember reading Ivies reject 3 out 5 valedictorians. My point is just that with these stats, he's not likely to stand out in these applications, and if he doesn't, he'll get rejected. And on top of that, he's a rich Asian guy applying as a math/CS major, which is a huge L. So the chances of rejected are hella high.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I told him, he got pissed and told me he didn't ask for my advice. That may be true, but I'm just trying to look out for him- he didn't apply to any safety schools (schools he's 90% going to get into, like state schools), so if he gets rejected from the prestigious, competitive schools he applies to, he'll literally have nowhere to go. so I don't think a little bit on unsolicited advice is wrong here- even if it hurts his feelings right now, convincing him his applications are a long shot is the only way to get him to apply to safeties, which is better for him long-term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

You could have shared your perspective on what makes a strong application and encouraged him to think about what makes him unique as an applicant.\n\nIn this case, it seems like your brother felt hurt and unsupported by your comments, which is understandable.

She already wants to marry him and have kids with him. And she wants the kids first. Shes trying to get pregnant. She says her plan is to get pregnant and move into the manufactured home her boyfriends parents are gifting him. \n\nShe is super big on her appearance and its extremely important to her. If she gets one zit she has a breakdown. I tell her \"but what about your body? Are you sure you want to do this so young?\"\n\nShe seriously looks me in the eye and says her body will go back to exactly the way it is and nothing will change. This is when I gave her an incredulous look and she got mad at me and called me a bad friend for not supporting her and that I'm ignorant to how pregnancy works. \n\nI may be young but I know for a fact that theres no way shes gonna look the same after she has a baby, considering she's short like I am as well. I told her that if she wants to have kids, that's her prerogative but I don't really want to have kids because I also care about the way my body and appearance is. She calls me selfish and that I'll regret not having kids someday. I just want dogs though. Anyway this isn't the point. \n\nShe thinks that by having a baby it will fix her life. She will stop doing drugs, smoking cigarettes, drinking and get a place to live. I told her she should do all that first and not after.\n\nShe says I'm an asshole and I should support her yet she doesn't support me not having kids.

It's understandable that you would be concerned about her wanting to have a baby at such a young age, especially given the circumstances you've described. It seems like you were trying to express your genuine concern for her well-being and future, but she interpreted it as a lack of support.\n\nIn this case, it might be helpful to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding. Instead of focusing on the negatives of her plan, you could ask her about her motivations and what she thinks having a baby will bring to her life. This could open up a dialogue where you can express your concerns without coming off as judgmental.\n\nUltimately, it's her life and her decision, but it's okay to share your perspective. Just remember to be kind and supportive, even if you disagree with her choices.",

Forgive the formatting, posting on mobile. \n\nI just came home from a long weekend away with my family visiting my sister and and BIL, and caught a nasty cold from my (adorable) nephew. I have been working while being sick since I got back, not wanting to request more PTO/sick time immediately after returning from vacation. I usually work 10-12 hour shifts that can go until late at night and spend that time mostly on my feet and being very active. Thanksgiving is my only day off for another week and so I decided to opt out of Thanksgiving dinner to rest at home alone. \n\nThat being said, my mom graciously offered to bring me a plate since I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it to enjoy the feast. She wasn\u2019t in charge of cooking or cleaning this year as my aunt was hosting, and I live on her way home from my aunts house, so it didn\u2019t seem like a huge imposition when she volunteered to drop it by after dinner. Throughout the day I declined a few other offers to have food dropped off to me by other friends in the area knowing I had my own family favorites to look forward to. \n\nAt around 10pm I find myself fighting to stay awake, hungry and beyond ready to enjoy my dinner. I start reaching out to my mom and offer to come by and pick the food up myself so I could eat and go to sleep. She apologizes as she has gotten pretty drunk and stayed later than she intended, but says they are leaving soon and will be by in 20 to drop off the food. An hour later I call again to offer to just pick it up as I am starving and really exhausted at this point and she again says not to come by and she will be right over. At 12:30 I tried calling and texting her that I was going to sleep and was disappointed not to get the chance to eat Thanksgiving dinner despite my multiple offers to come get it myself. She stopped answering and ignored the rest of my attempts to get a hold of her. \n\nI\u2019m pissed.

It's understandable to feel upset when someone makes a promise and then doesn't follow through, particularly when you were counting on that meal to help you feel better. \n\nYour mom's decision to drink and stay longer than planned, leading to her not delivering the food, is understandably upsetting. You had communicated your needs and even offered to pick it up yourself, which shows you were trying to be accommodating. \n\nIt's important to express how you feel to your mom, but also to approach the conversation with an open mind. She may not realize how her actions affected you, and discussing it could lead to a better understanding between you both. \n\nIn this situation, you have every right to feel upset, and it's okay to confront her about it. Just remember to communicate your feelings calmly and clearly.",

It might have been more effective to address the issue with her directly, rather than sending a class-wide email that could be perceived as targeting her child. \n\nIn this case, while your intention was to maintain classroom order, the method of communication may not have been the best approach. It could be seen as a lack of sensitivity to the individual situation, especially since you had already communicated with the parents about this issue before.\n\nSo, while you are not the \"asshole\" for wanting to enforce classroom rules, the way you communicated that could be seen as lacking in tact.

This is the first time we\u2019ve all gotten together since Christmas, and my cousin let me me know in advance that she went vegan at the start of January as one of her New Year\u2019s resolutions. It\u2019s something she\u2019s talked about doing for a while, but she didn't make the jump until recently. I told her I\u2019d make sure there was food for her.\n\nOne of my best friends got me a nice set of ramekins as a Christmas gift, and I decided to test them out by making some smoked salmon souffles for dinner. I was a little nervous because I had never tried out this recipe before, but they turned out great. I also made a devil\u2019s chocolate cake for dessert. \n\nFor the side dish, I put together a salad with lettuce, arugula, mixed berries, and a strawberry balsamic vinaigrette. It was really tasty, and I thought it would be a good idea to make enough so that everyone could have it as a side and my cousin could have a large portion for her meal. I also made sure to keep the dressing separate from the salad because I knew it had honey in it. \n\nMy cousin said she appreciated that I kept her in mind but that it seemed like her dinner was an \u201cafterthought\u201d and that salad wasn\u2019t a meal on its own. She said if I had told her I was only making her a salad she would have brought a dish of her own to share.\n\nThis really rubbed me the wrong way because I feel like I did go out of my way to include her. AITA?",
        "model_response": "Based on your description, it sounds like you put in a lot of effort to accommodate your cousin's dietary needs while also preparing a delicious meal for the rest of your family. You made thoughtful choices, like keeping the dressing separate and preparing a variety of dishes. \n\nHowever, it seems your cousin felt that the salad alone was insufficient for a meal, which is understandable from her perspective. While salads can be a great side dish, they may not be seen as a complete meal, especially for someone who is used to more substantial options. \n\nIn this situation, it might be helpful to have a conversation with your cousin about her expectations and preferences for future gatherings. You could also consider asking guests if they have any specific dietary needs or preferences when planning meals. \n\nOverall, it seems like you had good intentions and made an effort to include your cousin, so I would say you are not the asshole in this situation.",

This is the first time we\u2019ve all gotten together since Christmas, and my cousin let me me know in advance that she went vegan at the start of January as one of her New Year\u2019s resolutions. It\u2019s something she\u2019s talked about doing for a while, but she didn't make the jump until recently. I told her I\u2019d make sure there was food for her.\n\nOne of my best friends got me a nice set of ramekins as a Christmas gift, and I decided to test them out by making some smoked salmon souffles for dinner. I was a little nervous because I had never tried out this recipe before, but they turned out great. I also made a devil\u2019s chocolate cake for dessert. \n\nFor the side dish, I put together a salad with lettuce, arugula, mixed berries, and a strawberry balsamic vinaigrette. It was really tasty, and I thought it would be a good idea to make enough so that everyone could have it as a side and my cousin could have a large portion for her meal. I also made sure to keep the dressing separate from the salad because I knew it had honey in it. \n\nMy cousin said she appreciated that I kept her in mind but that it seemed like her dinner was an \u201cafterthought\u201d and that salad wasn\u2019t a meal on its own. She said if I had told her I was only making her a salad she would have brought a dish of her own to share.\n\nThis really rubbed me the wrong way because I feel like I did go out of my way to include her.

She has a 12 year old daughter from a previous relationship (lived together 2 years). Wedding booked in with deposit for 2021. Just started her 3rd year of Uni.\n\nSituation: In order to make us moving in together work, she got a part time job. We both contribute 100% of our finances. We are comfortable enough with the money we have to be able to have family vacations, run 2 decent cars, rent our house, never want for anything etc.\n\nShe has always insisted on working part time since we moved in together, but has always complained about her job, regardless of what it is (through 3 different ones). After her first proper shift in this 3rd job, she complained louder than ever, almost in tears when talking about it. I told her to quit now and look for another job, it wasn't worth ruining her dissertation year over. \n\nOver this period of complaining, she kept repeating to me \"I'm not a lazy person, I don't want to not-work, it's just this job.\" and \"I used to work full time and be a single mother, I'm a hard worker\".\n\nShe did, and she has offers of a couple of jobs now, but h has now started dragging her feet about getting started with these new jobs, as well as saying that she has been talking to some friends and that they think she shouldn't have to work, I should just be happy she is contributing her student finance to our outgoings.\n\nShe has also started saying that she is considering doing her Masters. Then her PGCE (teaching qualification).\n\nI am starting to get big \"I don't want to work\" vibes in general, which will definitely impact our future plans. Wedding, having a kid , buying a house. I am not down for having a child out of wed-lock and as I say we are both in our 30's, so it's not like we have an indefinite amount of time to do that.\n\nNow, I've never thrown my income in her face and dismiss the disparity if she raises it, but I used to have ~\u00a31500 disposable income before we moved in together, I now have none. I'm now getting concerned that she is more interested in extending the length of time that she doesn't have to work, rather than building our life together that we have had planned.\n\nWhenever we talk about it (it keeps coming back up), I say the same. Working part time and being at university is not impossible (her brother did it, my sister did it, one of my best friends worked full time while at Uni). That yes, we could get by without her wage, but things would be tighter and may impact our wedding/future plans.

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and concerned about your fianc\u00e9's current work situation and her commitment to your shared future. It's understandable to want her to contribute financially while she completes her studies, especially since you both have plans for marriage and starting a family.\n\nHowever, it's important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding. Your fianc\u00e9 may be feeling overwhelmed with her studies, her job, and the responsibilities of being a mother. It's possible that she is struggling to balance everything and may need support rather than pressure.\n\nHere are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Communication**: Have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns. Express how you feel without placing blame. Ask her how she feels about her current job and what her plans are moving forward.\n\n2. **Support**: If she is genuinely unhappy with her job, encourage her to find something that aligns better with her skills and interests. It\u2019s important for her to feel fulfilled in her work, especially while managing her studies.\n\n3. **Understanding**: Recognize that being a student and a parent is a significant commitment. If she feels that she cannot handle a job right now, it might be worth discussing how you can support each other during this time.\n\n4. **Future Plans**: Reiterate your commitment to your future together and how important it is for both of you to be on the same page regarding finances and responsibilities.\n\n5. **Flexibility**: If she is considering further education, discuss how that might impact her ability to work and how you can plan for that together.\n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance that works for both of you. If you can approach the conversation with understanding and a willingness to listen, it may lead to a more productive discussion about your future together.",

Very undecided here... I was at the casino with my mom and we were having fun, everything going normally. Right before we were leaving, one my best friend's texted me \"bet 20$ on 32!!\" (this is for roulette in case you don't know) because he saw my instagram story at the casino. I took this as a friendly suggestion and thought oh, maybe it will be good luck. in no way did the text suggest, I make the bet FOR him, but just as a suggestion. the exact text was \"bet 20$ on 32!!\".\n\nAnyway, I make the bet and somehow, win... the prize is hundreds of dollars, over $500. Anyway, right away, nothing to hide, I text my friend OMG IT WON!!!\" and hes like omg thats amazing... blah blah blah and I said thank you for the tip, you're good luck.\n\nAnyway, I thought that was the end of it, and in my mind, I planned to buy him dinner or something next time I saw him, but I've heard from multiple friends that he has been bad mouthing me behind my back that he expected I would offer him half. he's been saying I am selfish and the only reason I won is because of him (true). he has not said ANYTHING to me, but multiple people in our friend group told me he's upset about it. I wasn't going to etransfer him money that night (that seemed weird to me) and I literally haven't seen him since it was recently...\n\nshould I text him that I want to take him for dinner or drop it? am I the asshole if I give nothing now?

I didn't think to split the winnings since it was just a suggestion, but I'd love to take you out for dinner to celebrate.\" This way, you acknowledge his input while also standing your ground. \n\nUltimately, it's about communication.

In the past financial year we're directly responsible for X-thousands of people being made redundant and saving companies fat stacks of money. Basically, people are fallible flesh-bags and where practical we try and replace it with predictable, repeatable solutions.\n\nThis came to awkward scenario. We did an audit of a local industrial company that my parents work at. Throughout this audit, at times, I had to interact with departments/areas my parents were involved in to elicit processes, requirements, etc. After the review, we found we could cut over 60 jobs and improve output with introduction of a particular of-the-shelf solution that required some modification. We provided training and additionally audited aptitude and performance to note which workers would be best to retain, retrain or retrench.\n\nThe result (based on metrics and my work) was that my parents were part of this mass redundancy. I was not allowed to give my parents a heads up. After the news, my parents were/are livid at me. They're telling me I had no loyalty to them and should have fudged numbers to keep them there because they're not not going to find new jobs at their age. They asked me how I can sleep at night knowing I put them out of work. \n\nI told them that I take my job seriously, do my job well and I'm proud of doing a good job. But now my parents, siblings, extended family and some family friends are pretty much angry at me. I've gotten various messages that follow the theme that I should be ashamed. \n\nI'm not sorry for what I did. The job was an enjoyable, challenging experience and we ended up with a happy client!",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you are caught between your professional responsibilities and your family's feelings. While you did your job well and followed the ethical guidelines of your profession, the outcome has had a significant personal impact on your family. \n\nYour parents' anger is understandable; losing a job, especially after many years of service, can be devastating. However, you also have to consider that your role as a consultant is to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the workplace, which sometimes means making tough decisions that can affect people's lives.\n\nIt's important to remember that you are not personally responsible for the decisions made by the company regarding layoffs. Your job is to provide an objective analysis and recommendations based on your findings. If your parents' positions were eliminated as a result of your audit, it is not a reflection of your loyalty to them but rather a consequence of the business's need to adapt and survive in a changing market.\n\nIn this case, it seems you are not the one at fault. You did your job as required, and while it may have hurt your family, you should not feel ashamed of your professional accomplishments. However, it might be beneficial to have an open conversation with your family about the situation, explaining your perspective and the importance of your work, while also acknowledging their feelings.",

In the past financial year we're directly responsible for X-thousands of people being made redundant and saving companies fat stacks of money. Basically, people are fallible flesh-bags and where practical we try and replace it with predictable, repeatable solutions.\n\nThis came to awkward scenario. We did an audit of a local industrial company that my parents work at. Throughout this audit, at times, I had to interact with departments/areas my parents were involved in to elicit processes, requirements, etc. After the review, we found we could cut over 60 jobs and improve output with introduction of a particular of-the-shelf solution that required some modification. We provided training and additionally audited aptitude and performance to note which workers would be best to retain, retrain or retrench.\n\nThe result (based on metrics and my work) was that my parents were part of this mass redundancy. I was not allowed to give my parents a heads up. After the news, my parents were/are livid at me. They're telling me I had no loyalty to them and should have fudged numbers to keep them there because they're not not going to find new jobs at their age. They asked me how I can sleep at night knowing I put them out of work. \n\nI told them that I take my job seriously, do my job well and I'm proud of doing a good job. But now my parents, siblings, extended family and some family friends are pretty much angry at me. I've gotten various messages that follow the theme that I should be ashamed. \n\nI'm not sorry for what I did. The job was an enjoyable, challenging experience and we ended up with a happy client!",

Me (27F) and my husband, also 27, recently bought our first home. It's beautiful, the neighbors hate us. So, full disclosure, it's a huge four bedroom with a basement and we are staunchly childfree. We needed all the space because we plan on adopting pets. Right now we have a tank of exotic fish, a very old turtle, four cats including our kitten Isaac l. We're hoping for a pair of Fancy Rats because we hear wonderful things. Anyway, as you can tell, we wanted to provide the perfect environment for our menagerie of fur-babies so we bought a house with a bit of land, in case we get a dog.\n\nOur neighbors are all very much into kids and traditional family and when they learned we wouldnt be having kids they were absolutely beside themselves l. My husband and I are both ex-military so we're used to be childfree in a hostile LifeScript TM environment, we are unfazed.\n\nHusband and I also have great sense of humor, especially where the holidays are concerned. However, our humor is a bit Toilet. At Easter was had giant blow up bunnies in suggestive positions, fake bunny poop everywhere. At Halloween we carved pumpkins with rather vulgar designs, had rather R-rated decorations, my husband and I dressed up really well.\n\nFor Thanksgiving we had a hilarious but historically accurate First Feast decoration on the lawn. We deep fried our turkey in the backyard this year so we had a pardoning ceremony and donated some money to a shelter in honor of the bird we didnt eat.\n\nIn short, we are young and enjoying life. Our neighborhood has a Facebook page and this year one of the neighbors publically called us out on the facebook page telling us the neighborhood voted and we are asked not to decorate our house for Christmas because of the risk of obscenities.

            "input": "AITA for my mildly obscene holiday decorations? | Hey folks! Me (27F) and my husband, also 27, recently bought our first home. It's beautiful, the neighbors hate us. So, full disclosure, it's a huge four bedroom with a basement and we are staunchly childfree. We needed all the space because we plan on adopting pets. Right now we have a tank of exotic fish, a very old turtle, four cats including our kitten Isaac l. We're hoping for a pair of Fancy Rats because we hear wonderful things. Anyway, as you can tell, we wanted to provide the perfect environment for our menagerie of fur-babies so we bought a house with a bit of land, in case we get a dog.\n\nOur neighbors are all very much into kids and traditional family and when they learned we wouldnt be having kids they were absolutely beside themselves l. My husband and I are both ex-military so we're used to be childfree in a hostile LifeScript TM environment, we are unfazed.\n\nHusband and I also have great sense of humor, especially where the holidays are concerned. However, our humor is a bit Toilet. At Easter was had giant blow up bunnies in suggestive positions, fake bunny poop everywhere. At Halloween we carved pumpkins with rather vulgar designs, had rather R-rated decorations, my husband and I dressed up really well.\n\nFor Thanksgiving we had a hilarious but historically accurate First Feast decoration on the lawn. We deep fried our turkey in the backyard this year so we had a pardoning ceremony and donated some money to a shelter in honor of the bird we didnt eat.\n\nIn short, we are young and enjoying life. Our neighborhood has a Facebook page and this year one of the neighbors publically called us out on the facebook page telling us the neighborhood voted and we are asked not to decorate our house for Christmas because of the risk of obscenities. I was disappointed as was my husband.

We have done this for a couple years and we usually have a good time.\n\nFor some quick background, my Sister-In-Law, (who I will call Hanna) has a husband (who is unimportant for this story) and they have two kids, Jane (older sister who is 13) and Harry (younger brother who is 7, and both parents baby the hell out of him). I have a similar family, but instead of 1 daughter and 1 son, I have 2 sons who are 10 and 15.\n\nThis year started mostly the same, and my Sister-in-law\u2019s son has been there in years prior, but this year, Harry has been exponentially more annoying. My 2 sons complain that he asks them both for help with stupidly simple things (like turning on the greatest showman for him, which he watched 5-7 times while we were there) and asks them to ride bikes with him almost every hour (since Hanna doesn\u2019t let Harry go by himself in the small RV park we stayed in.)\n\nHanna is overly tolerant for everything Harry does, but is very hard on Jane. Hanna is so tolerant, that I believe Harry will be dependent on his parents for longer than he should (and trust me, it\u2019s not your average annoying 7 year old, it\u2019s been 3 days since we got home and my kids are still mad at how annoying he was, and how he ruined the trip)\n\nIn 2021, both of our families are going to Hawaii, and I honestly don\u2019t want Harry there. I think he would ruin the type of trip I want us to have, and I\u2019m thinking about backing out of the trip all together to avoid wasting money on a ruined trip.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I asked Hanna not to bring Harry?",
        "model_response": "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with your nephew's behavior during family trips, and it's understandable that you want to have a good time with your family. However, asking your sister-in-law not to bring her son could lead to hurt feelings and conflict within the family. \n\nInstead of outright asking her not to bring Harry, consider having a conversation with her about your concerns. You could express how you feel about the dynamics during the last trip and suggest that it might be better for Harry to stay home this time. However, be prepared for her to defend her parenting choices, and be respectful of her feelings.\n\nUltimately, it's important to prioritize open communication and understanding within the family. If you feel that Harry's presence would negatively impact your experience, it might be worth discussing, but be mindful of how you approach the topic.",

But the fastest way for someone to get me to not take a right on red is to honk at me.\n\nIf they honk at me I wave at them, watch them in my review mirror and calmly wait for the next green light. If they honk again or make hand gestures I wave again. Sometimes I'll give them a thumbs up. I find honking at people to be rude.",

It's understandable to want to prioritize safety over speed, especially when it comes to making turns at intersections. It's important to follow traffic rules and ensure that the way is clear before proceeding, even if it means waiting longer. \n\nIn this situation, you are not in the wrong for being careful and prioritizing safety over rushing through a turn. It's also reasonable to feel annoyed by other drivers who don't understand your cautious approach.",

One of the men asked me to put on headphones (which I didn\u2019t have) so I just turned it off. \n\nI waited for them to get ahead of me a little bit.  I started playing it again, but at a very low volume. The same man circles back and forces me to turn it off and starts recording me. I admit that the place kind of echoes so even playing it low you can still kind of hear, but if they kept going for a little more they would not have heard it. \n\nAs he\u2019s approaching me he said that there are signs saying no music. I\u2019m like oh really do you have a picture of it or will we pass by one? He says that we passed the last sign that had that \u201crule\u201d, how convenient. I would have googled it but I had no internet access. I go sir there\u2019s no one here who am I disturbing? He goes \u201cnature, the animals, and ppl who are passing by\u201d I said when I see people I turn it off, and I\u2019ve been on this trail and I\u2019ve seen multiple people playing music.

I understand respecting people\u2019s costumes but the entire group he was with made it seem like I killed someone, they gave me the dirtiest looks. I am younger than them they were in their 50s and I\u2019m 23, and I just did not understand the big deal.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you were not aware of the specific rules regarding music on the hiking trail, and you did turn it off when asked. However, the man who confronted you was clearly upset, and it seems that the music was loud enough to disturb others, even if you thought it was at a low volume. \n\nWhile you may not have intended to disturb anyone, it\u2019s important to respect the environment and the experience of others in nature. Many people go hiking to enjoy the peace and quiet, and loud music can detract from that experience. \n\nIn this case, it would be best to acknowledge that playing music while hiking, especially if it can be heard by others, is generally not considered respectful. It\u2019s understandable that you were frustrated by the confrontation, but it\u2019s also important to consider the perspective of others who may have been disturbed by the noise. \n\nOverall, it seems that this situation could have been avoided by adhering to the common etiquette of keeping noise to a minimum in natural settings.",

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a very difficult situation, and it's understandable to feel conflicted about it. Your primary concern is your daughter's safety and well-being, which is commendable. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Safety First**: If you genuinely believe that your daughter is being exposed to dangerous or harmful situations, it's crucial to prioritize her safety. If you have evidence or strong suspicions of neglect or abuse, you may need to consider contacting child protective services again, even if previous attempts were unsuccessful.\n\n2. **Open Communication**: Talk to your daughter about your concerns. Depending on her age, she may have insights into her sister's living conditions that could help you assess the situation better. It's important to keep the lines of communication open and honest.\n\n3. **Support for Your Daughter**: If your daughter values her relationship with her sister, it may be worth exploring ways to maintain that bond while ensuring her safety. This could involve supervised visits or finding alternative ways for them to connect that don't put your daughter at risk.\n\n4. **Setting Boundaries**: If you feel that continuing to support the family is enabling harmful behavior, it may be necessary to set boundaries. This could mean cutting off financial support or limiting contact until you feel it's safe.\n\n5. **Seek Professional Guidance**: Consider speaking with a counselor or social worker who can provide guidance on how to navigate this situation. They may have resources or advice on how to approach the family dynamics and ensure your daughter's safety.\n\nUltimately, you know your daughter best, and your instincts as a parent are important. Trust yourself to make the right decision for her well-being.",

We ended up with a F(24) roommate. \n\nWhen we were interviewing potential roommates she told us she works full time and she often spends the night at her boyfriends house and was looking mainly for a place to shower, do laundry and keep her stuff. There were other roommates who I liked better but my husband thought she was the best fit with not being home often and a reliable income. \n\nSince moving in we see even less of her than expected. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t come home for days at a time, and when she does it\u2019s usually for no more than a few hours. She\u2019s only spent the night maybe once a week. I tried to talk to her at first, but she didn\u2019t seem interested, so I gave up. I feel like she\u2019s a stranger in my home, but my husband thinks it\u2019s ideal and that we couldn\u2019t of gotten a better roommate. \n\nYesterday while my husband was at work and I was out doing grocery shopping, I came back to my roommates car in the driveway and an additional vehicle I\u2019ve never seen before parked out front of our house. \n\nI entered my home and saw my roommate and who I assume is a friend of hers in the kitchen. There was a rolled up bill and a credit card out, and the whole thing seemed suspicious to me. They quickly left after I got home. \n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t of done this, and realize it\u2019s an invasion of privacy, but I went through my roommate\u2019s room and found illegal drugs in her dresser drawer. \n\nI told my husband about it when he got home, and told him I want to give our roommate a 30 day notice. He told me I was being dramatic and that she\u2019s an adult and good roommate, and that we won\u2019t find anyone better. He also kept saying that we need the money.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems like there is a fundamental disagreement between you and your wife regarding how to approach storytelling and the concept of religion with your children. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Communication**: It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your wife about your perspectives on storytelling and the values you want to instill in your children. Discuss why you believe these stories are valuable and how they can teach morals without necessarily promoting a religion.\n\n2. **Respecting Boundaries**: While you may feel that the stories you are sharing are not overtly religious, your wife has expressed a strong stance against any mention of religion in your children's upbringing. It's crucial to respect her feelings and the agreement you both made. Finding a middle ground where both of you feel comfortable is essential.\n\n3. **Alternative Stories**: Consider exploring other stories that convey similar moral lessons without any religious context. There are countless fables, fairy tales, and moral stories from various cultures that can be shared without touching on religious themes.\n\n4. **Understanding Each Other's Backgrounds**: Recognize that both of you come from different cultural and religious backgrounds, and these experiences shape your perspectives. Understanding and respecting each other's upbringing can help bridge the gap in your disagreement.\n\n5. **Focus on Values**: Instead of focusing on the religious aspect, emphasize the values you want to teach your children\u2014kindness, honesty, bravery, etc. Look for stories that highlight these values without any religious connotations.\n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance that respects both your wife's feelings and your desire to share meaningful stories with your children.",

It's important for both of you to have support systems outside of your relationship.\n\n4. **Self-Care**: Take care of your own mental health as well. If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider talking to a therapist or counselor to help you process your feelings.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Relationship**: Reflect on whether this relationship is healthy for you. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and if you feel that trust has been broken, it may be worth considering whether you want to continue.\n\nUltimately, you are not responsible for her actions or her mental health.

Another guy from the chat hit me up and asked why I used that color emoji when our friend left.  He didn't come at me aggressively or anything, more just curious.

        "model_response": "It's understandable to feel concerned about how your actions may be perceived, especially in a diverse group. The key here is intent and awareness. If you truly did not mean to use that specific emoji and it was a mistake, it's important to acknowledge that and communicate that to your friends if it comes up again. \n\nHowever, it's also a good opportunity to reflect on the implications of using certain symbols and to be more mindful in the future. If your friends are comfortable discussing it, you could ask for their perspectives on the matter. Open communication can help clarify any misunderstandings and foster a better understanding of cultural sensitivities. \n\nIn this case, it seems like you are genuinely concerned and willing to learn, which is a positive approach.",

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a tough situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling frustrated. It's important to balance compassion for your daughter with the need for her to take responsibility for her life. Encouraging her to find work, even if it's not in her desired field, can help her regain a sense of purpose and independence. \n\nHowever, it's also crucial to approach this situation with empathy. Your daughter is likely feeling lost and ashamed after losing her job, and pushing her too hard might make her feel even worse. Instead of issuing ultimatums, consider having an open conversation with her about her feelings and the importance of finding work, even if it's not ideal. \n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance between supporting her and encouraging her to take steps toward rebuilding her life. It might be helpful to explore options together, such as job training or counseling, to help her navigate this difficult time.",

Communication is key in any relationship, and addressing the issue directly can help both of you understand each other's perspectives better. \n\nSo, in this case, it would be better to say that you are not the asshole for being concerned about safety, but you should also take responsibility for not being honest about it.",

However, your decision to keep your own orientation private is valid. It's okay to prioritize your comfort and readiness over the expectation to share that part of your life. \n\nIn this situation, you are not the asshole for not telling your nephew about your own sexual orientation. It's a personal choice, and you should feel empowered to make that choice based on your own feelings and circumstances.",

If the university has a contract with the travel agent and this is a compulsory arrangement, they may have reasons for the pricing that aren't immediately clear to you.

You have every right to express your concerns, especially if others in the group share your feelings. It might be helpful to approach the university or the travel agent with your concerns in a constructive manner, rather than expressing anger. \n\nIn summary, you're not an asshole for questioning the cost, but it's important to communicate your concerns respectfully and seek understanding rather than just expressing frustration.",

He also stopped cooking and pretty much any chores, saying I'm better at them than he is, which pissed me off but I wound up doing them anyway. He also stopped making an effort in terms of personality/behavior and became significantly more snappy and temperamental than he was when we lived apart. He also made these friends who smoke weed (legal here) and while I made clear that any form of smoking (or vaping) is a deal-breaker for me (nan died of lung cancer), I found out he'd been smoking it with them. 3 days after that he told me that he quit his job, because his stoner friends had convinced him to pursue his lifelong dream of being a rock-star in a band with them, despite none of them being able to sing or play any instruments. That really drove it home for me that he wasn't someone I wanted to be with, and there was no future there.\n\nI called my mum and told her everything, and she said that if I wanted to come home then I can. I sat him down, told him that I was breaking up with him, told him why, and he didn't take it well, asking for another chance, asking me to help him get his shit together, saying he'd un-quit his job and stop smoking.

Between the complete lack of effort in terms of housework, the smoking, quitting his job, and his views on split parenting, I don't think he's ready to have kids, or in a place where he'd be a good dad.

My girlfriend wasn\u2019t aware the dog had these problems but she did know she needed to house train it. When my dad learned about this he was pissed and he told my girlfriend to get her dog under control and that until it\u2019s trained she either has to cage it or leave it outside in the cold because he doesn\u2019t want it messing up his house. Since she spent most of her life in a cage my girlfriend doesn\u2019t want to cage her dog but he told me to make sure this rule is enforced. \n\nYesterday my dad told me he was coming over to talk to me about some things and to check on the house.

Throughout him yelling at her I stay quiet and don\u2019t intervene. He tells me he\u2019s disappointed in me because I betrayed his trust. I tell him I\u2019m sorry and that from now on the dog will be caged. After he leaves my girlfriend is in tears because I didn\u2019t say anything while he was yelling at her but mostly because I sided with my dad and will now be enforcing his rule.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you are caught between your father's expectations and your girlfriend's feelings. While your father has the right to set rules in his own home, it's also important to consider the well-being of the dog and your girlfriend's emotional state. \n\nYour girlfriend likely feels hurt and unsupported, especially since she is trying to care for a dog that has had a difficult past. It's understandable that she doesn't want to cage the dog, as it may feel like a punishment rather than a solution. \n\nOn the other hand, your father is concerned about the state of his home and the behavior of the dog, which is understandable as well. However, his approach to the situation\u2014yelling and insulting your girlfriend\u2014was not appropriate and likely made the situation worse.\n\nIn this case, it would have been better to communicate openly with your girlfriend about the issues with the dog and work together to find a solution that respects both your father's rules and the dog's needs. Perhaps you could have discussed alternative training methods or sought help from a professional dog trainer instead of siding with your dad in a confrontational manner.\n\nUltimately, it seems that both you and your girlfriend need to have a serious conversation about the dog's training and how to address the situation without resorting to caging the dog. It's important to find a balance that respects your father's rules while also supporting your girlfriend and the dog's well-being.",

I told her no at first but after thinking about it more I decided maybe I should. \n\nAfter thinking on it for a very long time I decided to just go ahead and take my moms deal. I registered for classes and was super excited to finally finish my associates degree.\n\nSo about two weeks before my lease was up my best friend called me and told me she found the perfect place and we could literally move in the day I have to move out of my apartment. When I told her I would be moving in with my mother and we could get an apartment together after the semester was over she got pissed. \n\nShe told me that she wasn\u2019t welcomed to stay at her fathers house for another 5 months and that she knew I would switch up on her. She blamed me for her probably having to be homeless! I told her she was just trying to manipulate me into what she wanted and that she was just mad because I was trying to better myself.

To put it in to perspective, our food bill each week is roughly three times compared to what I usually spend alone.\n\nYet she seems extremely selfconcious about this and as a result will act surprised when something is gone, try to blame me, states I am eating too much whenever I eat anything, essentially, she tries to deflect her eating habits and projects them on to me out of embarrassment about her eating so much I guess? The thing is, I don't care about her eating habits, she can eat whatever she wants to eat what I am done with is her constantly trying to blame me, whining about food and picking fights about it.\n\nI talked to her about it multiple times, argued with her about it multiple times but earlier today I just got so tired of another comment, this time brought on by me making a sandwhich  at 2 PM when I had eaten  at 10 AM I know right, horrible. So I told her that this crap was either going to stop right here and now or I'll kick her out and she can spend the coming weeks or months at her own place.

However, the way you approached the conversation may have come off as harsh and dismissive of her feelings. It's important to communicate openly and compassionately, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like eating habits and self-esteem.\n\nInstead of threatening to kick her out, it might be more productive to have a calm discussion about how both of you can feel comfortable in the living situation. Express your feelings without placing blame, and try to understand her perspective as well. This could help alleviate some of the tension and lead to a more positive outcome for both of you.\n\nIn this case, it seems like both of you are struggling with the situation, and it would be beneficial to work together to find a solution rather than assigning blame.",

However, it's important to approach this situation with sensitivity and support. While you may have valid concerns about her ability to handle the pressures of being a homicide detective, it's crucial to communicate those concerns in a constructive way rather than outright discouraging her dreams.\n\nInstead of telling her she should change her career plans, consider discussing her strengths and weaknesses with her. Encourage her to explore different roles within law enforcement or related fields that may be a better fit for her skills and temperament. It's also worth considering that many people on the spectrum can excel in various careers, including those in law enforcement, with the right support and training.\n\nUltimately, it's important to have an open dialogue with your daughter and her counselors, focusing on her interests and abilities rather than simply pointing out what you perceive as limitations.

We have done a lot together and are very close. They recently sold their house and are currently staying with Sarah's parents until they find a new one.\n\n I know her parents fairly well, and on the rare occasion will go over for dinner at their house. Ben and Sarah have two dogs and in the past,  I have watched them/house sat on the weekends when they go out of town. I do this for free, as they are my friends. \n\nA month ago, Sarah mentions \"Oh, by the way, we need you to watch the dogs at my parent's house the week of July 26th.\"  I figure it is just the weekend, but apparently it is Friday-Friday. I tell her I really don't want to do that and that'll be an inconvenience seeing's my work is 40 min away and I have to be up super early. She mentions that she will pay me (half hearted) and I tell her it's not about the money, and that if she can find anybody else, I will do it. \n\nFast forward to last Friday, and I get there after work and there is a itemized note for me. Halfway down the list the parents mention \"if you can mow the lawn, we would appreciate it, here's $40 for your troubles\" also, I smoke, (nasty habit) but would never smoke inside someone's house (I figured given history, that would be known, but number 8 is \"thanks for smoking outside\". That comment heavily annoyed me, because it seemed very passive aggressive and not needed. \n\nWell, I work in a factory 50 hours a week and it gets upwards of 130 degrees. The last thing I want to do is mow a lawn in 90 degree weather when I get home. The only reason I did it, was to be nice. Anyways, they have their dogs on leads, and the whole side of the house is covered in dog poo. I mowed the front, sides and skipped over that section. \n\nI text Sarah, that I mowed everything but that area, and that Ben could finish it when he got home.  I get the text back \"Please tell him that so it gets done. She paid you and I don't want it to be unfinished when we get home\". That sent me over the edge and I was fuming.

If you\u2019ve seen the documentary \u201ckids for cash\u201d than just know it\u2019s somewhere around that area. So six years ago we had this student that I\u2019ll call John. This boy was to be completely honest one of the most brilliant people I\u2019ve ever met. I wholeheartedly believe if he had chosen a different path in life he would have been valedictorian. But John just loved doing bad shit. Smoking in the bathroom, showing up to school baked, calling teachers ungodly names, fist fighting, you name he probably did it. \n\nBut honestly John wasn\u2019t a bad kid. His family was judged extremely harshly, all of them felons, each parent in and out of jail. So he was treated like white trash by students and teachers alike. It\u2019s understandable why he would act the way he would.\n\nSo it was half way through Johns tenth grade year when the superintendents son told John that he had been \u201cfucking his crackwhore mom all night long\u201d. John was 5\u2019 10\u201d and 140 pounds soaking wet at 16 years old. Despite that I have genuinely never seen a worse beat down in my life. It took less than an hour for me to get a call from the super telling me to get rid of him.\n\nI went along with it at the time not paying much thought to it. John was sent to the neighborhood reform school and from there to juvenile detention. Somewhere along the way he graduated high school early and joined the army. He\u2019s still a very active part of the community while on leave and I actually introduced him to a school assembly where he spoke of how he turned his life around. I thought at the time that my part in his life had been what had straightened him up. I noticed he was short with me before and after his speech but thought nothing of it, figuring he was a man of few words.\n\nYesterday I saw him eating lunch with an old teacher of his that I remember him being particularly close to. I went up to them asking if I could join and then John pulled me aside.\n\nHe gave me a speech about how I was a key piece in what was ultimately some pretty messed up experiences in his life. I don\u2019t remember too much of it except the words \u201cThe way you guys did me may have been standard, but it wasn\u2019t right.

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're grappling with a complex situation and reflecting on your past decisions as a principal. It's understandable to feel conflicted about the impact of your actions on John's life. \n\nIn this case, it's important to consider the context of your decision-making at the time. You were likely trying to maintain order and discipline in a challenging environment, but it's also clear that John's circumstances were difficult and that he was struggling. \n\nWhile you may have believed that expelling him was the right choice at the time, it seems that you now question whether there could have been a different approach that might have helped him more effectively. It's commendable that you are reflecting on this and considering the long-term effects of your decisions.\n\nUltimately, it's difficult to say definitively whether you were right or wrong in that situation, as it involved many factors and complexities. However, it seems that you have learned from this experience and are open to understanding the impact of your actions, which is a positive step forward.\n\nIn the end, it might be helpful to focus on the present and the positive changes that John has made in his life. You can take pride in the fact that he has turned things around and is now contributing positively to the community. It's never too late to learn from past experiences and strive to do better in the future.",

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and are looking forward to some time alone, which is completely valid. However, it's also important to consider your wife's feelings and the significance of family gatherings. \n\nIn a marriage, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their needs and desires. While wanting a weekend to yourself is understandable, it might be worth discussing with your wife why you feel this way and finding a compromise. Perhaps you could agree to join her for part of the visit or plan for a future weekend where you can have your alone time.\n\nUltimately, communication is key. If you can express your feelings without dismissing her desire for family time, it may help resolve the tension. So, while you may not be an \"asshole,\" it would be beneficial to approach the situation with empathy and understanding for both your needs and hers.",

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a very difficult situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and mental health. If you feel that your daughter is not respecting your home or your boundaries, it may be necessary to have a serious conversation with her about the living situation.\n\nBefore making any decisions, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Open Communication**: Try to have an honest conversation with your daughter about how you're feeling. Express your concerns and the impact her actions are having on you and the household.\n\n2. **Set Boundaries**: Clearly outline what you expect in terms of respect and responsibilities. Let her know that you cannot continue to babysit without any support or compensation.\n\n3. **Consider Alternatives**: If the situation does not improve, you may need to consider giving her a timeline to find alternative living arrangements. This can be a difficult decision, but sometimes it is necessary for both parties to grow.\n\n4. **Seek Support**: Talk to friends, family, or a counselor about your situation. They may provide valuable perspective and support.\n\n5. **Focus on Yourself**: Remember that your well-being is important. Take time for self-care and consider what you want for your future.\n\nUltimately, you deserve to live in a peaceful and respectful environment. If eviction becomes necessary, ensure that you follow legal procedures and give her proper notice. It's a tough decision, but sometimes tough love is needed for both parties to move forward positively.",

If claiming that minute of overtime is within the company's policy, then you are justified in doing so.\n\nUltimately, it comes down to your workplace's policies and your own values.

It's understandable to want consistency in how your parents enforce rules for both of you, especially since you both live under the same roof.\n\nFrom your perspective, it seems like you're taking your responsibilities seriously and are trying to communicate your feelings to your parents. It's also valid to feel upset that your brother is not being held to the same standards, especially since you are both adults in the eyes of the law.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider that your brother is legally an adult and may have different expectations and responsibilities than you do. That said, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't express your feelings to your parents about the situation. Open communication is key, and it might help to have a calm discussion with them about how you feel and what you believe is fair.\n\nIn this case, it seems like you're not the villain, but rather someone who is advocating for fairness and respect in your household. It might be helpful to approach your parents with your concerns rather than making ultimatums, as this could lead to a more productive conversation.\n\nSo, to answer your question: NTA (Not the Asshole).",

I consider him to be my friend. He drinks and sometimes overdoes it, and there are times when there's no talking to him when he's like this. During these times he's been known to want to be social or ask favors at what I consider to be inappropriate hours/circumstances.

I'm a fairly crucial opener, so unless I'm too sick to work I really need to be there. \n\nI was getting ready for work the other morning and there was a knock on the door. My boyfriend answered and it was my upstairs neighbor asking if we could go pick up his friend who was stranded downtown. My boyfriend said no, as his license is currently not valid and even if it was, I'm the only one with a car and I was heading into work soon. \n\nSo I'm walking out to my car and he's outside. I don't know if he was specifically waiting for me, but he asked me again and I told him I really had to be at work and couldn't do it. I asked about calling an Uber for the stranded friend, and he told me \"she's lost\". So not only would we be going downtown to pick up this person, we'd have to actually locate her as well. :/\n\nI ended up going in to work, but I still feel kinda bad for it. I don't think it was at all unreasonable of me to decline, but I keep thinking \"what if she was in trouble?\" or \"what if something were to happen to her and I could have prevented it?\".\n\nI'm honestly not sure why an Uber wouldn't have been an option unless they didn't have money for one, but I would have been fine helping them out with it if that was the case.

If your neighbor's friend was truly in trouble, it would have been more appropriate for your neighbor to seek help from someone else or arrange for an Uber. \n\nIn this situation, you are not the asshole (NTA). You had a legitimate reason for declining the request, and it's not your responsibility to take on the burden of someone else's choices, especially at such an inconvenient hour.",

The thing is, I don't take cricket as seriously as most guys my age- it's fun, to be sure, and being a good player improves your popularity and attraction from girls, but I'm not extremely attached to it and have zero intention of trying to go pro. That's why I don't join any competitive teams or coaching programs- I intend to study economics/business and probably go into business in the future, and plus I enjoy spending my free time hanging out. If I were to start playing competitively, that'd take up all my time for no reason.\n\nAnyways, I wanted to be captain of my team, and everyone expected me to be. I know for a fact that most of the team voted for me (votes are public). However, I was passed over and the captaincy was given to someone else because according to the coaches 'he has more ability to build camaraderie' (the coaches are the ones who ultimately decide, regardless of votes). I felt like I had been stiffed, and as I mentioned, I don't really care all that much for cricket to begin with- it's fun, but not so fun I had to stand being stiffed. So I quit in protest, and a few of my friends did the same.\n\nSince then, the team has been suffering a lot and losing matches, and the coach is asking me to come back.

If you were a key player, your absence could affect their performance. It might be worth reflecting on whether your desire to quit was more about the captaincy or if you genuinely didn't enjoy the experience anymore.\n\nIn this situation, it might be helpful to communicate with the coach and your teammates about your feelings.

She's single too. My friend seems to get annoyed whenever someone else sees him with her and says something like \"wow dude your mom is so hot! Last time I was at his place playing video games I was talking about how I'm single now and said something like \"I totally would be fine dating the MILF who also lives here!\" He got very uncomfortable and told me to never use that term to describe his mother again. I told him his mother is attractive and that's a fact so he shouldn't be uncomfortable and plus it's complimenting her, what's the problem?\n\nIs he right to be upset about this?",

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a very difficult situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and concerned about your wife's drinking. It's important to approach this issue with care and compassion, as addiction can be a complex and sensitive topic.\n\n1. **Communication**: It seems like you've tried to communicate your concerns, but it hasn't led to a productive conversation. It might be helpful to find a calm moment to express your feelings without placing blame. Instead of saying \"you drink too much,\" you could say something like \"I'm worried about your health and our relationship.\"\n\n2. **Counseling**: Suggesting counseling is a positive step. It shows that you're willing to work on the relationship and seek help together. If she's resistant, you might want to consider going alone to get support for yourself.\n\n3. **Ultimatums**: Ultimatums can sometimes backfire, as they may lead to defensiveness rather than openness. Instead of saying \"if you don't stop drinking, I'm leaving,\" you might want to express your feelings and concerns more gently.\n\n4. **Support**: Encourage her to seek help, whether it's through therapy, support groups, or talking to a doctor. Let her know that you're there for her and want to support her in making positive changes.\n\n5. **Self-Care**: Don't forget to take care of yourself during this challenging time. Seek support from friends, family, or a therapist to help you cope with the stress of the situation.\n\nUltimately, it's important to approach this issue with empathy and understanding, while also being clear about your own boundaries and needs.",

Since then we\u2019ve been very back and forth on how we should continue from here, but we\u2019ve always agreed that our respective partners should pretty much stay at arms length for the time being if we find ourselves in new relationships. \nWe\u2019ve since then both found partners we\u2019re happy with, and taken on our first \u201cserious\u201d relationship since our separation. \nHe\u2019s been seeing her (18F) for a couple months officially and has always told me he has absolutely no intention of having our daughter around her, despite my being okay with it. Even saying he didn\u2019t want her around and wasn\u2019t very serious with the girl at all. \nHer and I came together kind of behind his back. She seems to be sweet and we have a good relationship, we\u2019ve even had lunch several times. While getting to know her she\u2019s shared with me that she\u2019s essentially an party girl. That\u2019s fine. I was also an 18 yo party girl when he met me five years ago. \nThis does worry me though when I think about them getting serious, I am worried he will want her to give up her lifestyle and be more of the house-wife type (which is what he wanted me to be, ultimately being the reason behind our separation) and she\u2019s mentioned she doesn\u2019t really have any interest in that lifestyle. Either way, the girl hasn\u2019t any experience with children whatsoever. \nSo, with all that being said, suddenly her Facebook is flooded with pictures of my daughter? I guess this is fine. I\u2019ve recently decided to let my daughter see more of my partner, sometimes having him over for dinner and small interactions so I try to keep an open mind about him doing the same though it does somewhat bother me seeing her all over my kid. That\u2019s probably just my jealous streak talking, but I\u2019m confused as to why he so adamantly went from never wanting the GF to have anything to do with the babe, to suddenly having them together ALL THE TIME.

I call him to make sure that everything is okay and he has his girlfriend babysitting because \u201cthe baby didn\u2019t want to get up for school this morning\u201d. Wrong answer. \n\nI\u2019m so fucking pissed. \n\nI wasn\u2019t even working, why is his girlfriend watching the baby? She has no experience with children and we have agreed that pretty much no one is allowed to watch our baby that isn\u2019t one of our parents/at least a parent themselves. \n\nI very curtly told him that I was not okay with that at all, he of course told me he \u201cdoesn\u2019t see what the big deal is\u201d. He never does. Please someone tell me I\u2019m not crazy.

I turned 30 last Thursday. On Friday my wife threw threw me a big surprise birthday party at our house. I was completely shocked. She invited 30-35 of our mutual friends, decorated our whole house, cooked food for the event (and catered some), organized games and even got a friend to act a a DJ. The party was a lot of fun and I appreciated all the effort she put into it. I arrived at the party at around 8:00 and by 12:00 most people had left but there were still a few people there hanging around. She and her 2 sisters were starting to clean up\n\nThe thing is I have a good friend who owns a night club. That Friday was the opening day of the club and I had promised him I would make an appearance to show support.  I had mentioned this to my wife in the past but she doesn't know this guy very well an I guess didn't take it that seriously. I had also asked my wife if we had any plans that Friday and she would just say she wanted to go watch a movie, so I figured we could watch the movie and I could still go to the night club with no issue. Well alas, this surprise party happened and although I truly appreciated it, I didn't want to break the promise to my friend so at around 11:45 when the party had winded down I decided to leave to go to the club to fulfill my promise.

You appreciated the effort she put into the surprise party, and you also wanted to honor a commitment to your friend. However, the way you handled the situation\u2014leaving the party early\u2014was perceived as disrespectful by your wife, especially given the effort she put into organizing the event.\n\nWhile you may not have intended to hurt her feelings, the timing of your departure and the fact that it was your birthday party made it seem like you didn't value the celebration she arranged for you. It's understandable that you wanted to fulfill your promise to your friend, but it might have been better to communicate with your wife about your plans beforehand, especially since she was unaware of the commitment.\n\nIn this case, it would be best to acknowledge your wife's feelings and apologize for leaving without discussing it with her first. You could explain your perspective and reassure her that you appreciated the party, but also recognize that your departure may have hurt her feelings. Open communication is key in resolving this misunderstanding.",

            "input": "AITA for leaving the surprise birthday party my wife threw for me a little early to fulfill a promise to a friend? | My wife and I have been married for 2 years. I turned 30 last Thursday. On Friday my wife threw threw me a big surprise birthday party at our house. I was completely shocked. She invited 30-35 of our mutual friends, decorated our whole house, cooked food for the event (and catered some), organized games and even got a friend to act a a DJ. The party was a lot of fun and I appreciated all the effort she put into it. I arrived at the party at around 8:00 and by 12:00 most people had left but there were still a few people there hanging around. She and her 2 sisters were starting to clean up\n\nThe thing is I have a good friend who owns a night club. That Friday was the opening day of the club and I had promised him I would make an appearance to show support.  I had mentioned this to my wife in the past but she doesn't know this guy very well an I guess didn't take it that seriously. I had also asked my wife if we had any plans that Friday and she would just say she wanted to go watch a movie, so I figured we could watch the movie and I could still go to the night club with no issue. Well alas, this surprise party happened and although I truly appreciated it, I didn't want to break the promise to my friend so at around 11:45 when the party had winded down I decided to leave to go to the club to fulfill my promise. My wife didn't make a huge deal about it at the time although I could tell she was annoyed.\n\nHowever the next day she was obviously angry about it and told me she thought it was rude to just leave a birthday party she put so much effort into to go to a club and I made it seem like I didn't care.

They were trying to sell it for years but it never sold. They finally proposed a deal for us to buy it from them. It was a regular mortgage bank deal. We have a 15 year loan and they got their money now and out of the bills/taxes. We did get a discount, but we also had to deal with boxing up their stuff for them and having to clean the entire house (things they would have had to do themselves if it was sold to a stranger). \n\nAnyway, this was two years ago. All their stuff is gone minus a few boxes in the attic that they'll \"get later.\" They live in the next state over, and they come stay with us 4-5 times a year.

They sometimes give us a heads up, but we've also come home from work to find them in the living room watching TV. \n\nI have no problem with them visiting. I actually love it because I get to play hostess and they get to see their grandkid. My problem is with them acting like it's their house and they're allowed in freely. Anytime I tell my husband he says \"it's just while we transition\" or \"they have us a deal, be nice.\" We finally got into a fight on Saturday when we came home from garage sales and his parents were home with no notice.

You are not the asshole for wanting privacy in your own home and expecting notice before guests arrive. It's reasonable to want to maintain your space and have control over who enters your home. \n\nOn the other hand, your husband may feel a sense of obligation to his parents, especially since they helped with the house purchase. However, this does not mean that they should have unrestricted access to your home without prior notice. \n\nUltimately, it would be beneficial for both of you to have an open and honest conversation about boundaries and expectations regarding visits from his parents.

However, inserting yourself into their conversations is not the best way to handle it. While it may seem amusing to you, it can come off as rude or disruptive to others. Instead of engaging with them, it might be more effective to simply ignore them or find a way to distance yourself from the situation.

She's upset at her current weight. She's put on about 100lbs since we started dating. I've never mentioned it because she has bipolar disorder, and as I struggle with depression I fully understand how food can take the edge off when you get seriously overwhelmed with depression. But for health reasons and of course other reasons, of course I would like for her to get back to a healthy weight. \n\nMy girlfriend's bipolar disorder has been a challenge for me, as where I would normally be assertive in a relationship on issues - I often have to back down in arguments because she responds poorly to being challenged. I often feel like I'm walking on ice, but I do my best to try understand her and work at helping her and supporting her as best I can. \n\nShe is not happy with her current weight, and constantly remarks about it and has been complaining about it for over a year without doing anything about it. \n\n I tell her we can work on it together as a team, and both fix our diet. I feel this is the best way to go about it, rather than telling her that SHE needs to lose weight. I don't want her feeling like I'm initiating it, or that it's a journey she needs to take alone. Or that I'm pushing her to do it. For it to be a healthy journey, it needs to be something she is motivated to do and if I do it with her, then it doesn't feel like it's all on her.\n\nSo, last week she decided to work on her diet. She was upset today because she hasn't lost any weight yet. I told her to not worry about the short term results - that it had only been a week, but to focus on months down the line to see changes. She was extremely defeatist and said she'll never lose weight. This kinda irritated me, because it had only been a week since she started. \n\nI felt like she hadn't fully committed, because she was drinking soft drinks and eating chips which are high in carbs so I brought that up, if she wants to see results quicker - that cutting out the junk food completely (rather than cutting down) will help her. Now I understand she's trying to make a change, but the defeatist attitude after only a week is difficult to work with. \n\nShe then got angry at me and told me to \"stop arguing with me about my weight\". To which I replied that I wasn't, I had never in our entire relationship brought up her weight, and was just discussing her diet and how she was eating and drinking things that will make her progress slower. \n\nShe then told me to drop it and leave it alone, and is now in a huff with me for the past few hours over it. I understand this is the nature of her bipolar disorder, and she will shut down anything she's challenged about something. \n\nAm I the asshole for challenging her defeatist attitude on her results, when she was taking short-cuts with junk food?",
        "model_response": "It sounds like you're trying to be supportive of your girlfriend's journey to improve her health, which is commendable. However, it's important to approach sensitive topics like weight and diet with care, especially considering her mental health struggles. \n\nFrom what you've described, it seems that your intentions were to encourage her and help her stay motivated. However, your comments about her eating habits may have come across as critical rather than supportive, especially since she is already feeling defeated after only a week of trying to change her diet. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to communicate in a way that is constructive and empathetic. Instead of pointing out what she is doing wrong, it might be more helpful to focus on the positive steps she is taking and to encourage her efforts without criticizing her choices. \n\nGiven the context, it seems that your girlfriend is feeling overwhelmed and defensive, which is understandable. It might be beneficial to give her space and let her know that you're there for her without pushing her to change immediately. \n\nIn summary, while your intentions may have been good, the way you approached the conversation may not have been effective. It might be best to apologize for how your comments made her feel and to reassure her that you're there to support her in a way that feels safe and encouraging for her.",

            "input": "AITA in relation to my GF's attempt to lose weight? | I've been dating my GF for 3 years. She's upset at her current weight. She's put on about 100lbs since we started dating. I've never mentioned it because she has bipolar disorder, and as I struggle with depression I fully understand how food can take the edge off when you get seriously overwhelmed with depression. But for health reasons and of course other reasons, of course I would like for her to get back to a healthy weight. \n\nMy girlfriend's bipolar disorder has been a challenge for me, as where I would normally be assertive in a relationship on issues - I often have to back down in arguments because she responds poorly to being challenged. I often feel like I'm walking on ice, but I do my best to try understand her and work at helping her and supporting her as best I can. \n\nShe is not happy with her current weight, and constantly remarks about it and has been complaining about it for over a year without doing anything about it. \n\n I tell her we can work on it together as a team, and both fix our diet. I feel this is the best way to go about it, rather than telling her that SHE needs to lose weight. I don't want her feeling like I'm initiating it, or that it's a journey she needs to take alone. Or that I'm pushing her to do it. For it to be a healthy journey, it needs to be something she is motivated to do and if I do it with her, then it doesn't feel like it's all on her.\n\nSo, last week she decided to work on her diet. She was upset today because she hasn't lost any weight yet. I told her to not worry about the short term results - that it had only been a week, but to focus on months down the line to see changes. She was extremely defeatist and said she'll never lose weight. This kinda irritated me, because it had only been a week since she started. \n\nI felt like she hadn't fully committed, because she was drinking soft drinks and eating chips which are high in carbs so I brought that up, if she wants to see results quicker - that cutting out the junk food completely (rather than cutting down) will help her. Now I understand she's trying to make a change, but the defeatist attitude after only a week is difficult to work with. \n\nShe then got angry at me and told me to \"stop arguing with me about my weight\". To which I replied that I wasn't, I had never in our entire relationship brought up her weight, and was just discussing her diet and how she was eating and drinking things that will make her progress slower. \n\nShe then told me to drop it and leave it alone, and is now in a huff with me for the past few hours over it. I understand this is the nature of her bipolar disorder, and she will shut down anything she's challenged about something. \n\nAm I the asshole for challenging her defeatist attitude on her results, when she was taking short-cuts with junk food?",

She said she was happy to eat whatever I prepared for dinner but she would prepare her own (non vegan) breakfast and lunch to eat with the kids.\n\nHer room has a bathroom attached but no kitchen. She has her own cupboard in the kitchen and shelf in the fridge to store all her non vegan food. She has been with us for about 9 months now and so far she has been preparing her own breakfast (usually just yoghurt and fruit) and making herself a sandwich for lunch and then eating whatever I prepare for dinner with our whole family. Every Friday she has the afternoon/night off and I always cook her dinner and put it in the fridge for her to eat when she gets home. \n\nAbout a week ago she came home from her night off and I heard her in the kitchen. A couple minutes later I hear her cooking something and so I went out to say hi and see what she was doing. She was cooking a steak. At the time i didn\u2019t really have a problem with it. But the next night when I was about to serve dinner she goes to cook another steak. She eats her steak and it\u2019s fine but after I have a chat to her and she says she is kind of sick of the vegan food and that she will be preparing her own dinners if that\u2019s ok from now on.

I don\u2019t have a problem with her not eating vegan, it\u2019s a personal choice but I am kind of uncomfortable with it. So I asked her to just be more sensitive about cooking meat and maybe waiting until after the kids are in bed (so they can\u2019t smell it or know she\u2019s eating an animal) and she said she has the right to eat a proper meal.

You have asked her to be considerate of your family's values, and it seems she is not willing to do so. \n\nIn this case, it would be reasonable to have a frank discussion with her about your discomfort and the impact it has on your family.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems like there is a misunderstanding between you and your girlfriend regarding your friendship with the 16-year-old boy. You have formed a bond with him and are providing him with support during a difficult time, which is commendable. However, your girlfriend feels uncomfortable with the situation, and her concerns may stem from a lack of understanding of your intentions and the nature of your relationship with the boy.\n\nIt's important to communicate openly with your girlfriend about why you value your friendship with the boy and reassure her that your intentions are purely supportive. At the same time, it's essential to listen to her concerns and try to understand her perspective. \n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance between your friendship and your romantic relationship. If your girlfriend cannot accept your friendship with the boy, it may lead to further issues in your relationship. Consider discussing this matter with her calmly and respectfully to find a resolution that works for both of you.",

You offered the children options within your price range, and it is understandable that you would not want to give away your more expensive items, especially since you were running a business. Craft fairs are typically places where vendors sell their products, and while generosity is appreciated, it is not an obligation. \n\nThe lady next to you may have had a different perspective, but it is important to remember that you are not responsible for the financial situations of others. If you felt uncomfortable giving away your products, you were within your rights to maintain your pricing. \n\nIn future craft fairs, you might consider having a few lower-priced items or small giveaways to engage with the community, but you are not obligated to give away your work.

I have very carefully cultivated a life that doesn't involve my ex but ultimately he learned what state I lived in when I filed for divorce. I make a point not to give my information to anyone who is in anyway in contact with him.

I bought the dress immediately and was super excited because I could use the money I saved from not buying a more expensive dress on other things.\n\nThe dress came in and I tried it on for my cousin (I invited her over), and she was pretty upset. She said that she kind of expected that I would get a higher quality dress because I\u2019m a bridesmaid.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that your cousin's disappointment stems from her expectations regarding the quality and appearance of the bridesmaid dresses. While you did meet the color and length requirements, the material and overall quality of the dress may not align with what she envisioned for her wedding party. \n\nIt's important to consider that weddings often come with a certain level of formality and expectation, and brides typically want their bridal party to look cohesive and polished. While you may feel that the dress is fine and that you saved money, your cousin may have hoped for something that felt more special or luxurious for such an important occasion.\n\nIn this case, it might be worth having a conversation with your cousin to understand her perspective better. You could also consider looking for a different dress that meets her expectations while still being within your budget. Ultimately, it's about supporting her on her special day and ensuring that everyone feels good in what they're wearing.",

My mom & their dad have been together for a majority of our lives (15+ years) so growing up we all became very close, spent all our holidays & vacations together, etc. I truly don\u2019t consider them \u201cstep\u201d siblings - although we\u2019re not blood they are my family.\n\nThis past fall, my stepsisters got engaged. The younger sister chose me, my little sister, my step-sister, and her closest friends to be her bridesmaids (no MOH). However, my mom was the one to inform me & my bio sis that we wouldn\u2019t be in our other sisters wedding even though she chose TWELVE bridesmaids - including her new boss, a distant cousin, and a college friend she hasn\u2019t seen in years (her bio sis is the MOH). Although I\u2019m closer to the younger sister, I was genuinely hurt that my oldest sister picked twelve bridesmaids but didn\u2019t include us. My other siblings also thought this was a terrible move on her part.\n\nAdmittedly, I became a bit passive aggressive whenever the wedding was brought up. For example, my mom said I needed to wear a more formal dress for the wedding because \u201cwe\u2019re family so we\u2019re expected to be more dressed up than the rest of the guests\u201d and I responded by saying \u201cif my sister wanted me to be more dressed up than the rest of the guests, she would have made me a bridesmaid.\u201d My mom & step-dad get upset whenever I say anything remotely negative about her wedding, but I think they\u2019re reacting this way cause they were also hurt that my sister didn\u2019t include us.\n\nA few weeks ago, my other sister got married. At the reception, family members asked if I was excited to be in my oldest sister\u2019s wedding a few weeks later, but I awkwardly had to tell them me and my little sister were not asked to be bridesmaids. A lot of them were shocked and genuinely upset that she isn\u2019t including her stepsisters in her wedding party. Our grandmother (my step-dad\u2019s mom) was especially upset since she considers us all family & didn\u2019t understand why she would pick all those other people over us.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if anyone\u2019s actually told my sister how upset they are, but I do know my mom & step-dad are pissed at me. In my mind this was a complete slap in the face and has permanently damaged my relationship with my sister (though we clearly weren\u2019t as close as I thought in the first place) and I have a right to express my frustration and disappointment. However, they think I\u2019m overreacting and need to stop bringing it up, especially since her wedding is in a week and they think I\u2019m going to cause problems for my sister on her special day.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?",
        "model_response": "It sounds like you're feeling hurt and disappointed about not being included in your sister's wedding party, especially given the close relationship you have with your blended family. It's understandable to feel upset when you perceive a slight, particularly when it comes to family events that hold significant emotional weight.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider how your actions and comments might affect your sister and the family dynamics. While you have every right to express your feelings, being passive-aggressive or vocalizing your disappointment in a way that could create tension may not be the best approach, especially so close to the wedding.\n\nYour sister likely had her reasons for her choices, and while they may not align with your expectations, it's essential to respect her decisions. Instead of focusing on the hurt, it might be more constructive to communicate your feelings directly and honestly, without placing blame or making passive-aggressive remarks. \n\nUltimately, it seems like you are feeling left out and hurt, but it's crucial to approach the situation with empathy and understanding for your sister's choices. It may be beneficial to take a step back, focus on supporting her on her special day, and work on healing any rifts in your relationship afterward. \n\nIn this situation, it seems like you may not be the \"AITA\" but rather someone who is feeling hurt and disappointed. It might be best to focus on the positive aspects of your family and the love you share, rather than dwelling on the negative feelings.",

You both discussed this arrangement before moving in, and you have been considerate of your roommate's space and comfort by keeping your boyfriend in your room and being quiet. \n\nYour roommate's discomfort appears to stem from past experiences, which you may not fully understand. However, since you have made efforts to respect her space and maintain a low profile, it seems reasonable for you to continue having your boyfriend over. \n\nIt might be helpful to have an open conversation with your roommate to address her concerns and reassure her that your boyfriend's presence will not disrupt her comfort. Communication is key in shared living situations, and finding a way to make her feel more at ease could help resolve the issue. \n\nOverall, you are not the asshole in this situation, but fostering a dialogue with your roommate could lead to a better understanding on both sides.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that both you and your friend have valid feelings, but the way the situation has unfolded has led to a lot of tension. Your friend is upset because she feels that your new appearance does not align with the vision she has for her wedding, which is understandable given that weddings often have specific themes and aesthetics. On the other hand, you have the right to express yourself through your appearance, and it sounds like you were excited about your tattoos and hair color.\n\nHowever, the timing of your changes, especially so close to her wedding, has caused conflict. While you may have had these plans for a while, it\u2019s important to consider how your choices impact those around you, especially in a significant event like a wedding. \n\nIn this case, it might be best to have an open and honest conversation with your friend about both of your feelings. Apologizing for any distress your changes may have caused her and expressing your desire to support her on her special day could help mend the situation. Ultimately, it\u2019s about finding a balance between self-expression and consideration for your friend\u2019s feelings.",

This is because the majority of my family is fairly spread out throughout the US, so any visits are rather costly with airfare and hotels if someone doesn't have room for my fiance and I to stay for some time.

Sadly this was something my mother didn't seem to understand, and she was very upset when I told her I would not be going. She was very angry with me and went on about how all my many cousins and other family members were coming, it's so selfish of me not to attend my grandfather's funeral, I'm just being cheap, she planned the funeral closer to Christmas so I could be there for the holidays and now I'm ruining her Christmas, and the like.

I'm very sad that I wasn't able to go to the funeral, and I'd like to think my reasoning for not going is justified, but I can't help but wonder should I have tried to do more to get there? Should I have just paid the mortgage late, or maybe return some Christmas present I'd already bought by then, and does it make me an asshole that I didn't?

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a really tough situation, and it's understandable to feel conflicted about your decision. It's important to remember that you made a choice based on your financial situation and the realities of your life. Attending a funeral can be very important, but it shouldn't come at the cost of your financial stability, especially when you have responsibilities like a mortgage to consider.\n\nYour mother's reaction is understandable, as she is grieving and may feel hurt that you weren't there. However, it doesn't mean that your decision was wrong. You had valid reasons for not attending, and it's not fair for your family to label you as selfish or cheap without understanding your circumstances.\n\nUltimately, you need to prioritize your own well-being and financial stability. If you feel that your reasons were justified, then you shouldn't feel guilty about your decision. It might be helpful to reach out to your mother again when emotions have settled, to explain your perspective and hopefully mend things between you. Communication can often help in these situations.",

They took our 3 children (7f,5f and 3m) and placed them with my mom. Shortly after this my wife and I split up and she moved in with another guy. He was an old friend of mine so my kids know him but can\u2019t see him because of our situation. \nMy middle daughter still won\u2019t accept this and thinks once we get through this my ex and I will get back together. It\u2019s like she thinks the judge is not letting us be together. So I\u2019m having almost daily talks with my daughter trying to get her to understand that her mom and I will not get back together and her mom has a new boyfriend(fianc\u00e9)\nBack in October my middle daughter had her 5th birthday at a skate rink. My mom invited my ex as well which I have no problem with. We can be civil especially for a birthday party. \nAnyways, my daughter asks me if I will skate with her and then also grabs her moms hand. She then starts smiling and saying \u201cwe\u2019re a family again\u201d I then pull away and tell my daughter to go ahead and skate with mommy for a while and we can switch off. I was not comfortable with this. \nMy ex brought this up today and was saying I don\u2019t know how to coparent and I should have no problem skating together with our daughter. \nIn my opinion it\u2019s only making my daughter think that one day we will be a family again. I feel like she will only take it worse if we keep up the charades. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to do this?\n\nPs: I know every one kind of sucks here because of the drugs but we are both in recovery. So please don\u2019t base your opinion on that and only base your opinion on the situation at the skate rink ",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you are trying to be honest with your daughter about the reality of your family situation, which is commendable. You are prioritizing her emotional well-being by not wanting to give her false hope about you and your ex getting back together. \n\nYour ex's perspective may be different, as she might believe that co-parenting means being able to skate together and present a united front for your daughter. However, it's important to recognize that you have your own boundaries and feelings about the situation.\n\nUltimately, you are not the asshole for wanting to maintain honesty with your daughter. It's important to communicate openly with her about the changes in your family, and it sounds like you are doing your best to navigate a difficult situation.",

They took our 3 children (7f,5f and 3m) and placed them with my mom. Shortly after this my wife and I split up and she moved in with another guy. He was an old friend of mine so my kids know him but can\u2019t see him because of our situation. \nMy middle daughter still won\u2019t accept this and thinks once we get through this my ex and I will get back together.

However, it's also important to recognize that you were feeling hurt and upset about the situation. \n\nIn this case, it might be best to communicate openly with your boyfriend about how you both feel and try to resolve the misunderstanding. Apologizing for not wishing him a happy birthday and explaining your feelings could help mend things between you two. \n\nSo, while you may not be an \"asshole,\" it would be beneficial to take responsibility for the lack of communication and work towards resolving the conflict.",
