        "model_response": "Yes, you were an asshole for calling 911 on an 8-year-old boy for throwing rocks. While it's understandable to be frustrated with a child who is being disruptive, involving the police is an extreme reaction that can have serious consequences for a child. Instead of escalating the situation, it would have been more appropriate to address the issue calmly with the child or to speak with his parents directly. Your actions not only scared the child but also created unnecessary conflict with his family. It's important to handle such situations with more patience and understanding.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, your boyfriend likely felt hurt or rejected because he put effort into making dinner for you, and when you refused to try it, it may have felt like a dismissal of his effort. While it's understandable that you might not want to eat something that doesn't appeal to you, it could have been a good opportunity to at least taste it, even if you didn't want to eat a full serving. \n\nYour boyfriend's reaction suggests that he may have been looking for validation or appreciation for his cooking, even if it wasn't to your taste. Communication is key in relationships, so it might be helpful to discuss how you both felt about the situation. \n\nOverall, while you are not necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to eat the pasta, it could be seen as a missed opportunity to support your boyfriend and show appreciation for his effort. A gentle conversation about preferences and feelings might help clear the air.",

However, it's important to consider the context and the feelings of your father-in-law, who may find comfort and solace in his prayer, especially given his current medical and relationship issues.\n\nWhile you have the right to set rules in your own home, asking him not to pray at the table could come off as disrespectful to his beliefs and practices. Instead, you might consider having a conversation with him about your preferences and finding a compromise that respects both your needs. For example, you could suggest that he prays before the meal is served or that he keeps his prayer brief so that everyone can enjoy the meal while it's hot.\n\nUltimately, it would be best to approach this situation with empathy and understanding, recognizing that both your preferences and his beliefs are valid.

Since then we\u2019ve been very back and forth on how we should continue from here, but we\u2019ve always agreed that our respective partners should pretty much stay at arms length for the time being if we find ourselves in new relationships. \nWe\u2019ve since then both found partners we\u2019re happy with, and taken on our first \u201cserious\u201d relationship since our separation. \nHe\u2019s been seeing her (18F) for a couple months officially and has always told me he has absolutely no intention of having our daughter around her, despite my being okay with it. Even saying he didn\u2019t want her around and wasn\u2019t very serious with the girl at all. \nHer and I came together kind of behind his back. She seems to be sweet and we have a good relationship, we\u2019ve even had lunch several times. While getting to know her she\u2019s shared with me that she\u2019s essentially an party girl. That\u2019s fine. I was also an 18 yo party girl when he met me five years ago. \nThis does worry me though when I think about them getting serious, I am worried he will want her to give up her lifestyle and be more of the house-wife type (which is what he wanted me to be, ultimately being the reason behind our separation) and she\u2019s mentioned she doesn\u2019t really have any interest in that lifestyle. Either way, the girl hasn\u2019t any experience with children whatsoever. \nSo, with all that being said, suddenly her Facebook is flooded with pictures of my daughter? I guess this is fine. I\u2019ve recently decided to let my daughter see more of my partner, sometimes having him over for dinner and small interactions so I try to keep an open mind about him doing the same though it does somewhat bother me seeing her all over my kid. That\u2019s probably just my jealous streak talking, but I\u2019m confused as to why he so adamantly went from never wanting the GF to have anything to do with the babe, to suddenly having them together ALL THE TIME. I mean I go over there every now and then and it\u2019s just the three of them in the living room like they\u2019re having \u201cfamily time\u201d. I don\u2019t feel this is appropriate and I\u2019ve expressed that. \n\nToday I get a call from my mom who\u2019d stopped by school  to see the babe and..well, babe isn\u2019t there. I call him to make sure that everything is okay and he has his girlfriend babysitting because \u201cthe baby didn\u2019t want to get up for school this morning\u201d. Wrong answer. \n\nI\u2019m so fucking pissed. \n\nI wasn\u2019t even working, why is his girlfriend watching the baby? She has no experience with children and we have agreed that pretty much no one is allowed to watch our baby that isn\u2019t one of our parents/at least a parent themselves. \n\nI very curtly told him that I was not okay with that at all, he of course told me he \u201cdoesn\u2019t see what the big deal is\u201d. He never does. Please someone tell me I\u2019m not crazy. I understand he is her parent too, but he hasn\u2019t communicated ANYTHING with me regarding her when I\u2019ve given him the decency of doing so on my end.",
        "model_response": "Your feelings in this situation are completely valid. It sounds like you have concerns about your daughter's safety and well-being, especially given that your ex's new girlfriend has no experience with children. It's important for both parents to agree on who is responsible for their child, and it seems like there has been a breakdown in communication and trust regarding this issue.\n\nYou have every right to be upset that your ex did not consult you before allowing his girlfriend to babysit your daughter, especially since you both had previously agreed on certain boundaries. It's understandable to feel protective over your child and to want to ensure that anyone who is caring for her is capable and responsible.\n\nIt's also worth considering that your ex's sudden change in behavior regarding his girlfriend's involvement with your daughter could be a red flag. If he was previously adamant about keeping her away from your child and has now changed his stance without discussing it with you, it raises questions about his judgment and priorities.\n\nIn situations like this, clear communication is key. It might be helpful to have a calm and honest conversation with your ex about your concerns and to reiterate the importance of discussing any changes in childcare arrangements. Setting clear boundaries and expectations moving forward can help both of you co-parent more effectively.\n\nUltimately, you are not crazy for feeling the way you do. Your child's safety and well-being should always come first, and it's important to advocate for that.",

            "input": "AITA for not wanting my ex\u2019s new girlfriend to watch our three year old? | So my ex (30M) and I (23F) separated quite some time ago. Since then we\u2019ve been very back and forth on how we should continue from here, but we\u2019ve always agreed that our respective partners should pretty much stay at arms length for the time being if we find ourselves in new relationships. \nWe\u2019ve since then both found partners we\u2019re happy with, and taken on our first \u201cserious\u201d relationship since our separation. \nHe\u2019s been seeing her (18F) for a couple months officially and has always told me he has absolutely no intention of having our daughter around her, despite my being okay with it. Even saying he didn\u2019t want her around and wasn\u2019t very serious with the girl at all. \nHer and I came together kind of behind his back. She seems to be sweet and we have a good relationship, we\u2019ve even had lunch several times. While getting to know her she\u2019s shared with me that she\u2019s essentially an party girl. That\u2019s fine. I was also an 18 yo party girl when he met me five years ago. \nThis does worry me though when I think about them getting serious, I am worried he will want her to give up her lifestyle and be more of the house-wife type (which is what he wanted me to be, ultimately being the reason behind our separation) and she\u2019s mentioned she doesn\u2019t really have any interest in that lifestyle. Either way, the girl hasn\u2019t any experience with children whatsoever. \nSo, with all that being said, suddenly her Facebook is flooded with pictures of my daughter? I guess this is fine. I\u2019ve recently decided to let my daughter see more of my partner, sometimes having him over for dinner and small interactions so I try to keep an open mind about him doing the same though it does somewhat bother me seeing her all over my kid. That\u2019s probably just my jealous streak talking, but I\u2019m confused as to why he so adamantly went from never wanting the GF to have anything to do with the babe, to suddenly having them together ALL THE TIME. I mean I go over there every now and then and it\u2019s just the three of them in the living room like they\u2019re having \u201cfamily time\u201d. I don\u2019t feel this is appropriate and I\u2019ve expressed that. \n\nToday I get a call from my mom who\u2019d stopped by school  to see the babe and..well, babe isn\u2019t there. I call him to make sure that everything is okay and he has his girlfriend babysitting because \u201cthe baby didn\u2019t want to get up for school this morning\u201d. Wrong answer. \n\nI\u2019m so fucking pissed. \n\nI wasn\u2019t even working, why is his girlfriend watching the baby? She has no experience with children and we have agreed that pretty much no one is allowed to watch our baby that isn\u2019t one of our parents/at least a parent themselves. \n\nI very curtly told him that I was not okay with that at all, he of course told me he \u201cdoesn\u2019t see what the big deal is\u201d. He never does. Please someone tell me I\u2019m not crazy. I understand he is her parent too, but he hasn\u2019t communicated ANYTHING with me regarding her when I\u2019ve given him the decency of doing so on my end.",

This happened a couple of years ago, but it's always weighed on me heavily and I want to know who's the asshole in this situation.\n\nA couple of years ago my cousin asked me to be her bridesmaid. \nI agreed but felt it was just for show since she barely talked to me and it was super awkward at the bachelorette party and bridal shower, like she barely acknowledged me.  One day we went for a drive and she told me how two girls backed out of her bridal party and she couldn't bear if one more person did. She knew I had bad anxiety and asked me on the spot to tell her if I could do it or not. \nOf course I felt like how could I let her down so I said yes I would do it. \n\nMonths go by and the wedding is getting closer and my anxiety is getting worse and worse. I can barely leave the house and my medication isn't working like it used to. I know the wedding is approaching and is in a big church which causes me more anxiety. Like I was literally making myself sick over this. Could barely go to work or anything. \n\nFinally it's about the time for the wedding and I break down crying to my aunt (her mother) who I tell that I don't think I can do it but don't want to let everyone down. My family isn't very understanding of mental health. My aunt says don't worry, try to make it, do some practice at the church and if you can't make it no problem we will get you a new dress and you can just do the reception. I felt a bit better but was still struggling, I wanted to be able to do this. My aunt drives me to the church, which was locked and I walked around a bit, very shaky, very anxious and she was getting frustrated and so I acted like I was ok. \n\nThe day of the practice comes the day before the wedding and I'm throwing up and feeling so sick due to my anxiety, I've barely been sleeping. I break down to my family and told them I don't think I can do it. My aunt calls me and said in a very serious tone  \" I talked to your cousin and we both feel like you need to be there. So get ready\". At this point I'm breaking down. My cousin shows up at my place and I'm crying my eyes out and she's like cmon lets go, and I try to explain but she just looks at me with disgust and leaves. At this point my grandmother calls me and yells, your aunt called and said no wedding no reception. That broke me, my aunt broke her word and I felt so lost. So anxious. It didn't help that my boyfriend was away at work, so I had no one. I called a friend who drove me to my boyfriends house and his mom was amazing. She made me drinks, took me swimming and I tried to stay away from social media for my cousins wedding. \n\nI'm a lot better mentally. Got new medication and had therapy!",
        "model_response": "It sounds like you went through an incredibly difficult time, and it's understandable that you felt overwhelmed by anxiety leading up to your cousin's wedding. It's important to recognize that mental health struggles can be very real and debilitating, and it's not uncommon for people to feel pressured to fulfill commitments even when they're not in a good place to do so.\n\nIn this situation, it seems like you were put in a tough position by your cousin and your aunt, who may not have fully understood the extent of your anxiety. You expressed your feelings and concerns, but it sounds like they didn't provide the support you needed. It's not wrong to prioritize your mental health, and it's okay to step back from commitments that you feel you cannot handle.\n\nUltimately, you are not the \"asshole\" in this situation. You were honest about your struggles, and it seems like you did your best to communicate your feelings. It's unfortunate that your family didn't respond with the understanding and compassion you needed at that time. It's great to hear that you're feeling better now and have sought help through therapy and medication. Remember, taking care of your mental health is important, and it's okay to set boundaries for yourself.",

This happened a couple of years ago, but it's always weighed on me heavily and I want to know who's the asshole in this situation.\n\nA couple of years ago my cousin asked me to be her bridesmaid. \nI agreed but felt it was just for show since she barely talked to me and it was super awkward at the bachelorette party and bridal shower, like she barely acknowledged me.  One day we went for a drive and she told me how two girls backed out of her bridal party and she couldn't bear if one more person did. She knew I had bad anxiety and asked me on the spot to tell her if I could do it or not. \nOf course I felt like how could I let her down so I said yes I would do it. \n\nMonths go by and the wedding is getting closer and my anxiety is getting worse and worse. I can barely leave the house and my medication isn't working like it used to. I know the wedding is approaching and is in a big church which causes me more anxiety. Like I was literally making myself sick over this. Could barely go to work or anything. \n\nFinally it's about the time for the wedding and I break down crying to my aunt (her mother) who I tell that I don't think I can do it but don't want to let everyone down. My family isn't very understanding of mental health. My aunt says don't worry, try to make it, do some practice at the church and if you can't make it no problem we will get you a new dress and you can just do the reception. I felt a bit better but was still struggling, I wanted to be able to do this. My aunt drives me to the church, which was locked and I walked around a bit, very shaky, very anxious and she was getting frustrated and so I acted like I was ok. \n\nThe day of the practice comes the day before the wedding and I'm throwing up and feeling so sick due to my anxiety, I've barely been sleeping. I break down to my family and told them I don't think I can do it. My aunt calls me and said in a very serious tone  \" I talked to your cousin and we both feel like you need to be there. So get ready\". At this point I'm breaking down. My cousin shows up at my place and I'm crying my eyes out and she's like cmon lets go, and I try to explain but she just looks at me with disgust and leaves. At this point my grandmother calls me and yells, your aunt called and said no wedding no reception. That broke me, my aunt broke her word and I felt so lost. So anxious. It didn't help that my boyfriend was away at work, so I had no one. I called a friend who drove me to my boyfriends house and his mom was amazing. She made me drinks, took me swimming and I tried to stay away from social media for my cousins wedding. \n\nI'm a lot better mentally. Got new medication and had therapy!",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems like you have a valid point about the importance of paying attention while watching a movie. Movies are designed to be a visual experience, and looking at your phone frequently can lead to missing key plot points and details. However, it's also important to consider your girlfriend's feelings and how you communicate your concerns.\n\nWhile you may be frustrated that she isn't fully engaged, telling her to \"actually watch\" might come off as condescending or dismissive. Instead, you could express your feelings in a more understanding way, perhaps by saying something like, \"I really enjoy watching these movies with you, and I want to make sure we both get the full experience. Can we try to put our phones away while we watch?\" This approach acknowledges her feelings while also emphasizing your desire to enjoy the movie together.\n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance between enjoying the movie and respecting each other's preferences. Communication is key, so discussing how you both can enjoy movie nights together without distractions might help resolve the issue.",

We have been able to navigate a lot of the common issues that arise when two people start living together for the first time (cleanliness, cooking, bills, etc).However, we seem to have hit a roadblock when it comes to leaving candles burning when we both leave the house for work. She is very spiritual at times and believes that it helps to cleanse the aura of the house. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m against this kind of thinking at all, in fact I really enjoy being with someone who has her mindfulness. It\u2019s just that my anxiety levels immediately go through the roof when I start thinking about all the bad things that could happen if one of these candles flicks off an errant flame into the curtains and we ultimately end up not having a roof. So I\u2019ve taken to blowing out her candle(s) when I leave(she leaves before me) and then saying they must\u2019ve accidentally blown out whenever she asks about it later on in the day. ",

If he finds your reminders annoying, it might be worth having a conversation about it. You could express your concerns and explain why it matters to you, while also listening to his perspective. \n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance. If he continues to refuse to buckle up despite understanding your concerns, you may need to decide how much you want to push the issue. It's not unreasonable to want him to be safe, but it's also important to respect his autonomy as an adult. \n\nIn summary, you're not an asshole for caring about his safety, but it might be helpful to approach the situation with open communication and understanding.",

However, it's important to approach this situation with sensitivity and support for her aspirations.\n\nWhile your intentions may be to protect her from potential disappointment, outright discouraging her from pursuing her dreams can be harmful. It's essential to recognize her strengths and interests, and instead of telling her she can't achieve her goals, consider discussing alternative paths within the field of law enforcement or related areas that might be more suitable for her.\n\nEncouraging her to explore different roles, such as forensic science, victim advocacy, or other supportive positions in the criminal justice system, could allow her to stay connected to her interests while also considering her strengths and challenges.\n\nIn summary, while your concerns are valid, the way you communicate them is crucial. Instead of framing it as a limitation, try to foster an open dialogue about her goals and how she can achieve them in a way that aligns with her abilities. This approach may help her feel supported rather than discouraged. So, in this context, you might be seen as the one in the wrong for how you are handling the situation.",

I think I'm being realistic, and saving her from heartbreak and wasted education. AITA?",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re feeling conflicted about how to handle the invitation to your party. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Responsibility and Comfort**: It\u2019s important to recognize that you are not obligated to take on the responsibility of caring for someone else\u2019s health needs during a social event, especially when it\u2019s outside of a professional context. If you feel uncomfortable with the level of care Brenda requires, it\u2019s reasonable to prioritize your own comfort and enjoyment at your party.\n\n2. **Communication**: Being honest with Brenda about your concerns is crucial. You can express that while you appreciate her participation in the group, the level of care she requires is beyond what you can provide as a host. Framing it in a way that emphasizes your feelings rather than placing blame can help soften the message.\n\n3. **Group Dynamics**: It seems that the group may not be as enthusiastic about including Brenda, which complicates the situation. If the group is not comfortable with her presence, it might be worth discussing this collectively (without Brenda) to gauge everyone\u2019s feelings and come to a consensus on how to handle future gatherings.\n\n4. **Alternative Solutions**: If you decide to invite Brenda, you could consider arranging for her nurse to accompany her, which would alleviate some of your concerns. Alternatively, planning the party when she is unavailable could be a way to avoid direct confrontation, but it may feel disingenuous.\n\n5. **Potential Outcomes**: Be prepared for various reactions from Brenda. She may feel hurt or excluded, but it\u2019s important to stand by your decision if you believe it\u2019s the right one for you and the group.\n\nIn summary, while it may feel uncomfortable, being honest with Brenda about your limitations and the group\u2019s dynamics is important. You would not be an asshole for prioritizing your own comfort and safety, but how you communicate that can make a significant difference in how it\u2019s received.",

She loved this cat, it was her best friend of the whole world. She\u2019s had this thing for about 10-12 years, it went with her when she moved out from her parents place and everything. \n\nThe cat was kinda cute, small fluffy orange thing. I don\u2019t like cats, hate them. They\u2019re nowhere near as loyal as a dog, they claw everything and everyone, littler box in your house?! No thanks. I much prefer dogs but oh well.\n\n\nAnyway, when the cat died three months ago my friend was devastated, she cried and cried and cried. A week after the cats passing I asked her if she wanted to hang out but she declined saying she didn\u2019t want to go out.  I then asked her the following week but got the same response. A few days go by and I stop by her place, she lets me in and seems fine.\n\nWhen I walked in I saw a jar on her shelf in her living room next to the tv, taking a closer look it was the cats ashes with its name, age and some weird message on it next to a photo of her and the cat. I was immediately weirded out by that, why would you want a dead animals ashes in your home?\n\nShe did get better eventually but it was clear as day that she missed the thing. Well, last month was her 19th birthday and I thought... why not get her a cat? I\u2019m a good friend and it\u2019ll make her happy so she won\u2019t be as mopey. I stoped by the shelter a week before her birth and got a cat that looked something similar to her old one. By the time of her birthday I stopped by her house and her boyfriend was there.  I put it in a box (with holes) and have her the gift. When she opened the box she starts crying. I thought I did something good. Clearly not. She gave the box to her BF and went into her room. It being awkward I left.\n\nFast forward a few days later I get a message from the BF saying how that wasn\u2019t cool that I got a cat for her. He said something on the lines that she didn\u2019t want a cat at the moment. \n\n??! What? \n\nI told him that it\u2019s not like a person died. He didn\u2019t seem to like that answer and told me not to come over for a while. I said I wanted the cat back but he said no, he\u2019s looking after the cat. I paid for the cat, is she doesn\u2019t want it then put it back at the shelter for someone who does want it. He proceeded to call me an asshole and a bitch. \n\nSo, AITA?",
        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it seems that your intentions were to help your friend feel better after the loss of her cat, but the way you went about it was not considerate of her feelings. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Timing and Grief**: Your friend was still grieving the loss of her cat, and while you may have thought that getting her a new cat would help, she may not have been ready for that. Grief is a personal process, and everyone handles it differently. \n\n2. **Personal Choice**: Getting a pet is a significant decision that involves responsibility and commitment. Your friend may not have been in a place to make that decision for herself yet. \n\n3. **Communication**: It would have been more appropriate to discuss the idea of getting a new cat with her first, rather than surprising her with one. This could have opened up a conversation about her feelings and whether she was ready for a new pet.\n\n4. **Respecting Boundaries**: Your friend's reaction indicates that she was not ready for a new cat, and it's important to respect her feelings and boundaries. \n\nIn conclusion, while your intentions were good, the execution was lacking in sensitivity to your friend's emotional state. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that you may be considered the \"asshole\" in this situation for not fully considering her feelings and readiness for a new pet.",

He didn\u2019t seem to like that answer and told me not to come over for a while. I said I wanted the cat back but he said no, he\u2019s looking after the cat. I paid for the cat, is she doesn\u2019t want it then put it back at the shelter for someone who does want it. He proceeded to call me an asshole and a bitch. \n\nSo, AITA?",

        "model_response": "Your situation raises some interesting points about cultural integration and expectations when living in a foreign country. While it's understandable that you feel frustrated with your neighbors for not making an effort to learn the local language, it's also important to consider how you communicate that frustration.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Moving to a new country can be challenging, and language barriers can make it even more difficult. While you have taken the initiative to learn Chinese, not everyone may have the same resources or ability to do so, especially if they have been relying on English-speaking staff.\n\n2. **Communication Style**: Telling your neighbors that they should learn Chinese may come off as harsh or condescending, especially if they are already feeling overwhelmed. A more empathetic approach might help foster better relations.\n\n3. **Setting Boundaries**: It's perfectly reasonable to set boundaries regarding your willingness to translate for them. However, how you communicate that boundary can make a significant difference in how it is received.\n\n4. **Expectations**: While it is reasonable to expect long-term residents to learn some of the local language, it's also important to recognize that everyone has different circumstances and motivations for learning a language.\n\nIn summary, while you may not be in the wrong for wanting your neighbors to learn Chinese, the way you approached the situation could be perceived as inconsiderate. It might be helpful to reflect on how you can express your feelings while also being understanding of their challenges.",

Prior to this my mil wanted nothing to do with me at all and refused to talk to me whenever I was with his family. When I found out I was pregnant she all of a sudden started to get closer to me and I thought she was just genuinely taking interest in me for once and I did whatever I could to make her happy.

        "model_response": "It sounds like you are in a very difficult and distressing situation with your mother-in-law (MIL). Your feelings of frustration and concern for your daughter's well-being are completely valid. It\u2019s important to prioritize your mental health and the safety of your child in this scenario.\n\nBlocking your MIL out of your life is a significant decision and should be considered carefully. Here are some points to think about:\n\n1. **Boundaries**: It seems like your MIL has overstepped many boundaries, which can be harmful to both you and your daughter. Establishing clear boundaries about what is acceptable behavior and what is not is crucial. You might want to communicate these boundaries directly to her.\n\n2. **Support System**: Lean on your partner and your own family for support. It\u2019s essential to have a united front when dealing with difficult family dynamics. Discuss your concerns with your partner and ensure that you both agree on how to handle the situation.\n\n3. **Professional Help**: Given the complexities of your situation, it might be beneficial to seek advice from a family therapist or counselor. They can provide guidance on how to navigate these relationships while prioritizing your mental health and your daughter\u2019s well-being.\n\n4. **Communication**: If you feel safe doing so, consider having a candid conversation with your MIL about your concerns. Express how her actions have affected you and your family. Sometimes, people may not realize the impact of their behavior until it\u2019s pointed out.\n\n5. **Legal Considerations**: If your MIL continues to overstep boundaries, especially regarding medical decisions and your daughter\u2019s care, you may need to explore legal options to protect your rights as a parent.\n\n6. **Gradual Distance**: If you decide that blocking her out completely feels too extreme, consider gradually reducing contact. This can help you assess how you feel without the pressure of an all-or-nothing approach.\n\nUltimately, your priority should be the health and happiness of your daughter and yourself. It\u2019s okay to take a step back from relationships that are harmful or toxic. Trust your instincts and do what feels right for your family.",

At fancier restaurants, the plating can be very elaborate. We had it sitting between us, and I had already taken a few bites.

Soon, I would learn she was suggesting she should take a fork and stir the whole bowl, evenly distributing all the ingredients, and, in my opinion, ruining the deliciousness of the dish (and also making cold ingredients soggy). \n\nI laughed at first, almost confused as to why anyone would do this.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems like there are a few layers to unpack. Your discomfort with being tickled is valid, and it's important for your partner to understand and respect your boundaries. It sounds like you've communicated your feelings about tickling, but he may not fully grasp how it affects you.\n\nAs for the farting, while it was likely intended as a playful response to a frustrating situation, it may not have been received that way by your partner. He might have felt embarrassed or disrespected, especially if he was already upset about the tickling. \n\nIt's understandable that you don't see your action as wrong, given the context of your relationship and the familiarity with bodily functions. However, it's also important to consider how your partner felt in that moment. Open communication is key here. It might be helpful to have a conversation about both of your feelings regarding tickling and bodily functions, and to find a compromise that respects both of your boundaries. \n\nUltimately, whether you are \"the asshole\" in this situation may depend on how you both navigate this conversation and understand each other's perspectives.",

It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  \n\n\nTo complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?\n\n ",
        "model_response": "Your concerns about the Amber Alert system and its implementation are valid, especially regarding the timing and the impact on people who are trying to sleep. However, the context of the situation\u2014specifically that a child was abducted\u2014adds a layer of complexity to your complaint. \n\nWhile it's understandable to feel frustrated about being woken up by an alert, the primary purpose of Amber Alerts is to disseminate critical information quickly to help locate abducted children. In this case, the alert was issued with the hope that someone might have seen something that could lead to the child's safe return. \n\nGiven that the child was ultimately found deceased, it can be perceived as insensitive to focus on the inconvenience of the alert rather than the tragic outcome. Many people might view your complaint as being out of touch with the urgency and seriousness of the situation.\n\nIn summary, while your feelings about the alert system are not inherently wrong, the timing and context of your complaint may lead others to view you as an \"asshole\" for prioritizing personal inconvenience over the potential for saving a child's life. It's a difficult situation, and many would likely empathize with your frustrations while also recognizing the importance of the alert system.",

It's important in a relationship to express your feelings and boundaries, but it's also crucial to consider the other person's perspective. \n\nYour girlfriend has her own autonomy and friendships, and it's natural for her to want to spend time with people she gets along with, including your friends. If you've expressed your feelings multiple times and she continues to meet with them, it may be that she doesn't see it as a problem or feels that it's not a threat to your relationship.\n\nIn this situation, it's essential to have an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. Instead of insisting she stop seeing your friends, try to understand her perspective and find a compromise that works for both of you. \n\nUltimately, whether you're the \"AITA\" (Am I The Asshole) in this situation depends on how you approach the conversation and whether you're willing to listen to her side as well.

Your initial approach of asking if she was aware that her music was playing out loud was reasonable, as it could have been an honest mistake. However, when you labeled her behavior as \"very distracting\" and \"inconsiderate,\" it may have come across as confrontational, which could explain her quiet response and quick departure.\n\nOffering to buy her headphones, while perhaps intended as a helpful gesture, could also be interpreted as patronizing or implying that she couldn't afford her own. This might have added to her discomfort in the situation.\n\nOverall, while your intention to address the noise was valid, the way you communicated your concerns may have made you come off as rude or overly critical.

There were three girls, and four guys. One of the guys is gay, well call him Charles. Charles is a good friend of my girlfriends.\n\nWe had a table at a club and we were pregaming while the girls were taking their time to get ready. When the girls went off into our bedroom, I noticed that Charles was following them. \n\nI called my girlfriend over and told her that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with Charles being in there while she was changing. She laughed at me and told me that Charles is helping them with their makeup. She said he would rather hang out with them. \n\nAnnoyed that she just laughed at my face, I called Charles over and told him to have a drink with us until the girls were finished getting dressed. My girlfriend told him to ignore me and pulled him into the bedroom with her and the other girls. \n\nI felt myself starting to get angry so I went into my bedroom and confronted my girlfriend. I asked her why she insisted on having another man in here while she was undressed. She tried to make a point of Charles being gay, and I didn\u2019t care. A man is a man. Then she told me that Charles had seen them naked many times and it wasn\u2019t a big deal. \n\nI turned to start questioning Charles, and my girlfriend jumped in. It started a huge argument. After some time everyone was screaming and yelling at each other, and the girls made me leave the room. The guys tried to calm me down, but they got where I was coming from. I ended up not going to the club with them. \n\nWhen my girlfriend returned home she refused to talk to me. I tried to explain to her that she was being disrespectful. She said that I made an ass of myself in front of all of our friends and really embarrassed her. I reminded her that if she had just been respectful none of this would have happened, it\u2019s not ok for another man to see her naked when she\u2019s in a relationship. The other guys agreed with me but were afraid to say anything.\n\nShe left and is not speaking to me right now, and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the asshole here.",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that both you and your girlfriend have different perspectives on boundaries and comfort levels in your relationship. Your feelings of discomfort about another man being present while your girlfriend was changing are valid, as everyone has their own boundaries regarding privacy and modesty. However, your girlfriend's response indicates that she feels comfortable with Charles, especially since he is gay and has been a friend for a long time.\n\nThe key issue here is communication and respect for each other's feelings. While you were expressing your discomfort, it may have come across as controlling or overly possessive to her, especially since she felt that Charles being there was not a big deal. The argument escalated, which likely made the situation worse for both of you.\n\nIt's important to have open discussions about boundaries in relationships, but it's also crucial to approach these conversations calmly and respectfully. If you had expressed your feelings without confrontation, it might have led to a more productive discussion.\n\nIn conclusion, while your feelings are understandable, the way you handled the situation may have contributed to the conflict. It might be beneficial to reflect on how to communicate your feelings in a way that fosters understanding rather than confrontation. So, while you are not necessarily the \"asshole,\" there are aspects of your approach that could be improved for better communication in the future.",

We have a 3 month old who is the only grand child on my side of the family, and the only one in the state on hers, so we have a lot of family looking to come and visit frequently.  Our families live 1-2 hours away so it\u2019s usually more like day visits instead of quick visits.  \n\nObviously, with me working full time and my wife staying home with a baby who needs almost constant care (along with a 9 month old puppy) and also working a part time remote job, certain house keeping items can fall through the cracks and we get behind.  I will point out that we do keep a clean house, I come home from work most nights and tackle either dishes or laundry, and we pick up the clutter and vacuum pretty regularly.\n\nOur mindset is that if family members come to visit for the day on a weekend, we expect them to do more than just hold the baby, but actually help out by maybe doing the dishes, switching laundry to the dryer, taking the dog for a walk, etc just so we can lean on their support for a small break from all the stuff that piles up.  Some family members are super giving with their time/efforts and are happy to help, but my wife\u2019s mom and step dad basically expect to come and hold the baby without doing anything else.  We have to specifically ask them to do things if we want them to help, and if they do it it\u2019s usually with a pretty snarky/put off attitude.\n\nThis was capped off last night when they came to babysit while we went to my company\u2019s Christmas party, and as we were all dressed up and heading out the door, my MIL called out to my wife for help because our son had a poopy diaper and she made us change it before leaving. It\u2019s a small thing but it made my wife confront them about not being helpful when they come to visit, and her mom responded that \u201cthat\u2019s not what grandmas are for\u201d and that if we need help we should just hire people for it (they are pretty well off, but we don\u2019t have money for a nanny or anything.)\n\nSo we really want to know, are our expectations too high for support from family when they come visit, or is it fair to expect some pitching in when they\u2019re here for several hours/a whole day?

        "model_response": "Your expectations for family members to help out when they visit, especially given your current situation with a newborn and a puppy, are reasonable. It's common for new parents to seek support from family, and it's understandable to hope that visitors would contribute in some way beyond just holding the baby. \n\nHowever, it's also important to recognize that not everyone may share the same understanding of what \"help\" looks like. Some family members may feel that their role is primarily to bond with the baby, while others may be more willing to pitch in with household tasks. \n\nIt sounds like you've already had a conversation with your in-laws about your needs, but their response indicates a disconnect in expectations. It might be helpful to have a more direct conversation with them about what specific tasks you would appreciate help with during their visits. Setting clear expectations can sometimes help bridge the gap between different perspectives on family visits.\n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance that works for you and your family while also respecting the boundaries and perspectives of your relatives. If they continue to resist helping out, you may need to adjust your expectations or consider limiting visits to those who are more willing to support you in the way you need.",

        "model_response": "Your situation with your mom seems quite complex, and it touches on various sensitive issues related to body image, self-esteem, and the dynamics of your relationship. Here are some thoughts on the matter:\n\n1. **Communication**: It sounds like there may be a lack of open and honest communication between you and your mom regarding your feelings about her comments and behavior. While you expressed your discomfort with her wanting to dress similarly, it might be helpful to have a more in-depth conversation about how her comments about size and clothing affect you.\n\n2. **Body Image**: Your mom's comments about size and her recent cosmetic procedures suggest that she may be struggling with her own body image. This could be influencing her behavior towards you and your clothing choices. It might be worth considering that her desire to dress like you could stem from her own insecurities or a desire to connect with you.\n\n3. **Boundaries**: It's important to establish boundaries in any relationship, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like body image and clothing. You have every right to express your feelings and set limits on what you're comfortable with regarding your mom's comments and actions.\n\n4. **Empathy**: While it's understandable that you feel frustrated with your mom's behavior, try to approach the situation with empathy. She may not fully realize how her comments affect you, and a gentle conversation could help her understand your perspective.\n\n5. **AITA Perspective**: From an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) perspective, it seems that you were expressing your feelings honestly, but the way it was communicated may have hurt your mom. It's important to balance honesty with sensitivity, especially when discussing topics that can be deeply personal.\n\nUltimately, it might be beneficial to have a calm and constructive conversation with your mom about how you both feel regarding clothing and body image. This could help improve your relationship and lead to a better understanding of each other's perspectives.",

I don\u2019t buy many snacks because my husband works and I\u2019m a SAHM, and he usually only eats one large helping of dinner while he\u2019s at work since he sleeps in as long as possible. So the fridge has food in it. \n\nFast forwards to just now, I was sort of hungry, but not enough to cook a whole meal and decided I would go get some sushi as a snack from the store. It costs like $7, I was going to hold me until I start dinner probably around 7 or so. I announced my plans as I picked up my keys, and my husband asked if I would bring him back something also. I said sure and asked what he wanted. He asked if I would bring back hot wings and an oven pizza. I told him to pick something else, something smaller, and he demanded to know why. I said bc I just spent $100+ on groceries: if he wants a meal there\u2019s food in the kitchen. I\u2019m just going to grand a small snack - my item will be $7, his would be $15+, and it\u2019s not like we\u2019re rolling in money - we live paycheck to paycheck, and there\u2019s been several times where we have no food at the end of the month while we wait for the next payday. \n\nAnyway, he gets pissy and says he doesn\u2019t say that to me when he goes to pick up McDonald\u2019s or something for us. I said yes, but in that situation we\u2019re getting the same amount of food for the same amount of money, when there\u2019s no other food around. We have food, I\u2019m just getting a snack. I can get pizza and hot wings the next time I go grocery shopping, though. \n\nWell he goes off. Starts saying that I\u2019m calling him fat and I\u2019m being a hypocrite and it\u2019s okay for me to go get myself sushi and he can\u2019t get what he wanted. I tried to re-explain but it\u2019s like he was only hearing what he wanted to hear. I got so fed up I just walked outside to cool off. I feel like I was being fair, am I the asshole here?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems like you are not the asshole. You communicated your reasoning clearly: you had just spent a significant amount of money on groceries, and you were only going out for a small snack. Your husband\u2019s request for a larger meal, especially when there is already food available at home, seems unreasonable given your financial situation. \n\nIt's understandable that he might feel frustrated, but it appears that you were trying to be responsible with your budget while also addressing your own hunger. You offered to get him something smaller, which shows that you were willing to compromise. His reaction seems disproportionate to the situation, and it sounds like there may be underlying issues regarding communication and expectations in your relationship that could be addressed. \n\nOverall, your decision to prioritize your budget and the food already available at home is reasonable, and you are not in the wrong for wanting to stick to that.",

        "model_response": "Your feelings about not wanting your potential girlfriend to apply at your job are understandable, and it's clear that you're considering both your personal boundaries and her career opportunities. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Personal Space**: It's completely valid to want to maintain some separation between your work and personal life. Many people feel that having a partner at work can complicate things, especially if the relationship doesn't work out. Your concern about potentially \"suffocating\" each other is a legitimate one.\n\n2. **Career Opportunities**: You also seem to genuinely care about her career and recognize that applying to your company might not be the best move for her, especially given her qualifications and the potential for better opportunities elsewhere. This shows that you're thinking about her best interests, not just your own.\n\n3. **Communication**: It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with her about your concerns. Explain your feelings and the reasons behind them. This way, she can understand your perspective and you can both discuss what this means for your relationship.\n\n4. **Compromise**: Consider if there might be a middle ground. For example, if she applies and gets the job, you could agree on boundaries to maintain your individual spaces at work. \n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance between your personal feelings and her aspirations. As long as you communicate openly and respectfully, you can navigate this situation together.",

However, the key issue here is that you did not consider his feelings or preferences regarding public recognition. Your friend clearly expressed that he did not want attention for his actions and preferred to keep his experience private.\n\nWhile your post was positive and well-meaning, it ultimately disregarded his wishes. It's important to respect people's boundaries, especially when it comes to personal matters like volunteering and self-improvement. Your friend may have felt uncomfortable with the attention and the perception that he was seeking validation or recognition for his actions.\n\nIn summary, while your intentions were kind, you did not take into account your friend's feelings about public acknowledgment. Therefore, it would be fair to say that you are not the \"asshole\" in the sense of having malicious intent, but you did make a mistake by not consulting him first. It would be a good idea to apologize and acknowledge his feelings, as this could help mend any tension between you.",

Humor can sometimes cross a line into insensitivity, especially when it targets someone's hard work and accomplishments. \n\nIn this situation, it might be worth reflecting on whether the laughter you derive from this is worth the potential harm to your relationship with your SIL and the feelings of those around you. If your goal is to maintain a positive family dynamic, it may be beneficial to reconsider your approach and find ways to engage with her that are more supportive rather than antagonistic. \n\nSo, in summary, yes, you might be the asshole (YTA) for continuing to make comments that you know upset her, especially when they undermine her hard work and achievements.",

However I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being unfair to 1 daughter over the other, as my wife is now starting to rethink the rent decision and thinks it would be better if we charged neither.",
        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a challenging situation, and it's understandable to question whether your approach is fair to both daughters. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Contribution vs. Rent**: Your 21-year-old daughter is providing significant support to the household by taking care of chores and responsibilities that you and your wife are unable to manage due to your disabilities. This contribution is valuable and should be recognized. Charging rent to the 22-year-old while not charging the 21-year-old could be seen as unfair, especially if the 21-year-old's contributions are essential to the household's functioning.\n\n2. **Financial Independence**: The 22-year-old is working full-time and likely has more financial independence than the 21-year-old. Charging her rent may be a way to encourage financial responsibility, but it\u2019s important to balance that with the contributions of the 21-year-old.\n\n3. **Open Communication**: It might be helpful to have an open discussion with both daughters about the situation. This can provide clarity on how they feel about the rent situation and whether they believe it\u2019s fair. It can also help you gauge how each daughter views her contributions and responsibilities within the household.\n\n4. **Reassessing the Decision**: If your wife is reconsidering the rent decision, it might be worth exploring alternatives. For example, you could consider a system where both daughters contribute in ways that reflect their circumstances\u2014perhaps the 21-year-old could contribute in a different way that acknowledges her support without financial burden.\n\n5. **Family Dynamics**: Since both daughters are close, maintaining that relationship is important. Ensuring that neither feels undervalued or unfairly treated can help preserve harmony in the family.\n\nUltimately, fairness in family dynamics can be complex, especially when different members contribute in various ways. It\u2019s important to weigh the contributions of both daughters and consider their feelings in your decision-making process.",

        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it seems that you took responsibility for the incident initially, but then your stepdad, who is the owner of the aggressive dog, took over the responsibility for the vet bill. Since you communicated this to the carer of the injured dog and provided her with your stepdad's contact information, it appears that you did your part in redirecting the responsibility to the appropriate person.\n\nFrom what you've shared, it seems reasonable for you to step back from the situation after your stepdad took responsibility. If the carer is unwilling to communicate directly with him and is instead threatening legal action against you, it may not be fair for her to hold you accountable when you have already indicated that your stepdad is responsible for the payments.\n\nIn summary, it seems you acted appropriately by informing the carer of the change in responsibility and providing her with your stepdad's contact information. If she continues to pursue you for payment despite this, it may be more of an issue between her and your stepdad rather than you. Therefore, it doesn't seem like you are in the wrong for how you handled the situation.",

I said I was just cleaning up after my dog, and she said that dogs weren't allowed on the property, and she didn't want dog shit in the dumpsters for everyone to smell, and she would call the cops if I didn't leave immediately. I threw the poop away even though she told me not to, and left. \n\nI know that I was trespassing, but I think that the two alternatives (not cleaning it up or carrying it for half an hour or more) were worse.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you had good intentions by wanting to clean up after your dog, but you also knowingly trespassed on private property. While your desire to dispose of the dog waste properly is commendable, the fact that you ignored the property owner's wishes and the clearly marked private property signs complicates the matter.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, you were trespassing, which is generally not acceptable, regardless of your intentions. The woman had every right to be upset, especially since she mentioned that dogs weren't allowed on the property. \n\nIn terms of social norms, many people would likely understand your dilemma but still feel that you should have respected the private property rules. A more appropriate approach might have been to carry the waste with you until you found a public trash can or to ask the woman if there was a way to dispose of it without causing a problem.\n\nSo, while your intentions were good, the action of trespassing and disregarding the property owner's wishes does make you somewhat in the wrong.

I'm struggling with this. \n\nI'm the parent of a 2 year old child. Over the last year I've fought through a fairly high conflict divorce and custody fight. The process was ugly but custody and placement is shared 50/50. The court orders require that expenses related to the child are to be split 50/50. Expenses greater than $100 must have the consent of both parties before being undertaken otherwise it becomes the sole responsibility of the purchasing parent.  \n\nI live in an area known for long and cold winter weather. Approximately a month and a half ago I approached my ex about setting up our child with winter clothing while it was readily available. They hemmed and hawwed and eventually came up with a hand me down coat that was already a size too small. It is usable now but will not last the winter.  We were still without boots, mittens,  and snow pants.  \n\nWithin the last week temperatures have dropped sharply and we've received our first snows. It could not be put off any longer so I purchased the needed clothing. Hat, mittens, properly fitting coat, boots and snow pants.  The total expense was under $100.  When I presented the receipts to my ex, the refused to pay for their half of the expenses, citing a lack of funds. I am not insensitive to that,  and suggested that they pay me back over the winter as they're able. They refused, stating they didn't have the money and it didn't matter if they paid me or not- the clothes were already purchased. \n\nI was put off by this- the tone and tenor of the conversation was very much along the lines of \"what will you do about it?

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems you are caught between wanting to ensure your child has the necessary winter clothing and feeling frustrated by your ex's refusal to contribute to those expenses. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Child's Well-Being**: Your primary concern should be your child's well-being. If your ex is not providing adequate winter clothing, it may be in your child's best interest to ensure they have what they need, even if it means keeping the new clothes for your own placement weeks.\n\n2. **Legal Obligations**: Since you have a court order that requires shared expenses, you are within your rights to expect your ex to contribute. However, if they refuse, you may need to weigh the legal implications versus the immediate needs of your child.\n\n3. **Communication**: It might be worth having another conversation with your ex, emphasizing the importance of your child's comfort and safety during the winter months. If they still refuse to cooperate, you may need to make a decision based on what you believe is best for your child.\n\n4. **Future Implications**: Consider how your decision might affect future co-parenting dynamics. If you choose to withhold the clothing, it could escalate tensions. However, if you provide the clothing and document the expenses, you may have a stronger case for future discussions about shared costs.\n\n5. **Support System**: Lean on your family and friends for support. They may offer additional perspectives or even help you navigate this situation.\n\nUltimately, while it may feel unfair to keep the clothing for yourself, if it ensures your child has the proper winter gear, it could be justified. You are not responsible for your ex's financial choices, and your child's needs should come first. If you decide to keep the clothing, make sure to communicate your reasoning clearly to your ex to avoid misunderstandings.",

I moved in 1 and a half months ago after my old roommates got us evicted and I had nowhere else to go. I didn't have any savings so she said I could move in and she'd give me a couple months to pay her retroactively for rent and bills. Rent + bills is like 850 a month so I owed her for part of last month, all of this month, and then of course June rent and bills are coming up. I've given her like $800 so far. She also paid the movers so I am paying her back for that too. It's a lot. I've given what I can spare right now but I got a raise at work so we should hopefully be square in a month, or so I thought.\n\nNow she's trying to tell me that I owe her for taking my clothes to the laundromat, the food that I ate, and because I drank a couple bottles of her wine. She is seriously tacking on more to what I owe her and yes she did pay for all of that, but she never SAID I had to pay her for it. I just assumed I'd buy groceries sometimes after I pay her back.\n\nThis all came out because I sent her $100 yesterday and I tried marking down that I paid her the $100. She said no, it was only $30 because we went to the grocery store afterwards and we got $100 worth of stuff but $70 of it was mine. I said it was meant to share but she said she didn't want the kind of stuff I bought. To be fair, it isn't really the kind of stuff she gets for herself, but the stuff I ate of hers wasn't the stuff I'd get for myself either.\n\nThen she tells me that if I want to count the whole $100 to what I owe, that she is going to make me pay for everything I had the past month and a half. Like, seriously, two bottles of wine for $80! Lunch meat that is $13/lbs?? I think she is being insane if she expects me to pay that much, especially since I told her she can eat what I got but she doesn't want to because it's \"cheap\" in her words.\n\nAITA for not wanting to pay her back for the stuff I ate since she never said I had to, plus it's way more expensive stuff than I would ever buy?",
        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it seems that there is a misunderstanding between you and your sister regarding the expectations of sharing expenses and what you owe her. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Communication**: It appears that there was a lack of clear communication about what expenses you would be responsible for while living with her. If she never explicitly stated that you would need to pay her back for food, laundry, or wine, it may be unreasonable for her to suddenly impose those costs on you.\n\n2. **Shared Living Arrangements**: In many shared living situations, it's common for roommates to share groceries and household items without keeping strict tabs on who owes what, especially if both parties are contributing in different ways. If you both agreed to share expenses in a more casual manner, it might be worth discussing that approach again.\n\n3. **Fairness**: If the items she is charging you for are significantly more expensive than what you would typically buy, it may feel unfair to you. It\u2019s important to have a conversation about what is reasonable and fair for both of you.\n\n4. **Future Expectations**: Moving forward, it might be helpful to establish clearer guidelines about shared expenses, including groceries and household items, to avoid similar conflicts in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems you are not the \"AITA\" (Asshole) in this situation, as you were not made aware of the expectation to pay for those additional items. However, it would be beneficial to have an open and honest conversation with your sister to clarify expectations and find a resolution that works for both of you.",

No, my mother didn't cheat (she's the black half of the relationship), but most people usually assume I'm latino or from some foreign country, or that my brothers are from another father and my mother must be white.

When a new (white) co-worker of mine heard me greet him by calling him darkie she looked noticeably shocked, and after the call ended she started to have a real go at me and told me that I had no right to speak that way. I told her that I consider myself black and she had the audacity to laugh at me and then tell me that I was white passing (I'm pale but I don't look white so I consider that pretty fucking silly to say) and then asked me if I was a quarter cherokee.

        "model_response": "This situation is complex and touches on sensitive issues related to race, identity, and language. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Context and Intent**: You have a personal history with your family that includes playful banter about race. However, the context in which you used the term \"darkie\" was in a professional setting with someone who may not understand your familial dynamics. Intent does not always equal impact, and what may be acceptable in a private context can be perceived very differently in a public or professional one.\n\n2. **Identity and Perception**: You identify as Black and have a connection to your Black family, which is valid. However, the co-worker's reaction suggests that she may not recognize your identity in the same way, especially if she perceives you as \"white passing.\" This can lead to misunderstandings about who has the right to use certain language.\n\n3. **Professional Environment**: Workplaces often have policies regarding language and behavior that promote inclusivity and respect. Using racially charged language, even if it is part of your personal history, can lead to discomfort and conflict in a diverse workplace.\n\n4. **Reactions of Others**: The fact that some of your friends were uncomfortable and that the situation escalated to the point of involving your boss indicates that your comments had a significant impact on those around you. It's important to consider how your words affect others, regardless of your intent.\n\n5. **Humor and Sensitivity**: While humor can be a way to navigate difficult topics, it can also be hurtful. The line between humor and offense can be very thin, especially regarding race. \n\nIn summary, while you may not feel that you did anything wrong based on your personal context, the broader implications of your words in a professional setting and the reactions of others suggest that this situation is more nuanced. It may be beneficial to reflect on how to communicate your identity and humor in a way that is respectful and considerate of others' perspectives.",

My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?",

My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he\u2019d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was \u201cgo go go.\u201d\n\nDriving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some \u201calone time\u201d to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn\u2019t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there\u2019s anything else he\u2019d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he\u2019s sure because I\u2019m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. \n\nFIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It\u2019s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that\u2019s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he\u2019s suddenly asking me if that\u2019s how much is left, and I tell him I don\u2019t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can\u2019t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn\u2019t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. \n\nI poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. \n\nHe thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby. \n\nAITA?",

I usually don\u2019t pay them any mind, but she had this maybe 2 year old child limp in her arms, it looked out cold. \n\nAs a mom myself to a 15 month old, I got sick to my stomach imagining the stories of beggars who give their children drugs to sleep so they can illicit sympathy from passerbys. \n\nI called the police, which Greeks don\u2019t typically do. I told them where she was and that she had a limp child in her arms and I was worried about his wellbeing. All they told me was thank you for bringing this to our attention and hung up. I assume they probably didn\u2019t do anything about it, and I didn\u2019t stick around to see. \n\nI got home and told my husband what happened and was met with abrupt hostility and anger concerning what I did. Apparently 1. It wasn\u2019t my business and 2. I\u2019m not supposed to get involved with crime concerning gypsies because they are \u201catimi\u201d meaning, have no honor and can retaliate and 3. I made a fool of myself because the cops won\u2019t do anything anyway and I\u2019m the only idiot who would call the police.\n\nI suppose this hostility comes from the fact that I\u2019m an American and my husband is Greek and hes offended by my idealistic views, etc. \n\nI\u2019m just flabbergasted at how I\u2019m in the wrong. Am I dumb and an asshole for thinking someone would save this child? (And for assuming it was in danger in the first place?)",
        "model_response": "Your intentions in calling the police seem to stem from a place of concern for the child's wellbeing, which is understandable as a parent. However, the situation is complex and involves cultural sensitivities and perceptions about the community you encountered. \n\nFrom your husband's perspective, there may be a belief that intervening in such situations can lead to unintended consequences, especially given the historical context and societal views surrounding the Romani community (often referred to as \"gypsies\"). His reaction may reflect a desire to protect you from potential backlash or conflict.\n\nIn terms of whether you are an \"asshole\" for your actions, it largely depends on the context and the motivations behind them. While your concern for the child's safety is valid, the way you approached the situation may not align with the cultural norms of the area. It's important to consider that not everyone may share the same views on intervention, especially in sensitive situations involving marginalized communities.\n\nUltimately, it's a matter of perspective. You acted out of concern, but it's also essential to recognize and respect the cultural dynamics at play. Engaging in a conversation with your husband about these differences in perspective might help bridge the gap in understanding.",

My current boyfriend and i got pregnant with our first child(we were trying) i love my boyfriend a lot and after sean died i never thought i could love someone as much as i loved him, but when i met my boyfriend, i felt safe and loved. Here comes the complicated part, From day one i have made it super clear i will be naming my son after sean. My boyfriend always brushed it off because i guess he didn\u2019t think i was serious. When we found out it was a boy, i told him again i am still naming him sean, my boyfriend ignored my comment. For MONTHS any time he\u2019s asked about deciding a name i tell him, i have my name. And every time he rolls his eyes and walks away. Cut to two days ago, i go in for my c section, after my little man came out, we spent time together and then came us filling out paperwork for his name. And like i said i would, i put sean, and since my boyfriend had already signed the paperwork/birth certificate, i signed it and i said \u201ci put his name down\u201d to my surprise my boyfriend looked at the paper and flipped his shit. He was yelling about how disrespectful i was for naming my son after my ex. I tell him, \u201ci\u2019ve told you even before we got pregnant i\u2019m naming him sean.\u201d he\u2019s mad and i told him i could care less that he\u2019s mad when i specified for MONTHS what his name would be. My boyfriend left and i turned in his birth certificate to the nurse. I am home with baby (i had my mom drive) and he hasn\u2019t been here. His whole family has been blowing me up about how rude i am for doing that. So, AITA?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you have a strong emotional connection to the name \"Sean\" due to your past relationship and the loss of your ex. You communicated your intention to name your son after him multiple times, and it appears that your boyfriend did not take your feelings seriously or engage in a meaningful discussion about it.\n\nWhile it's understandable that your boyfriend may feel hurt or disrespected by the choice of name, especially if he felt excluded from the decision-making process, it also seems that you were clear about your intentions from the beginning. Naming a child is a significant decision that ideally should involve both parents, but given that you had expressed your desire consistently, it could be argued that you were within your rights to name your child as you wished.\n\nUltimately, whether you are the \"asshole\" in this situation may depend on the perspectives of those involved. You might consider discussing this with your boyfriend to understand his feelings better and to find a way to address the situation together. Open communication could help resolve the conflict and lead to a better understanding between you both.",

Part of that, was renting out a room of this restaurant on Saturday afternoon. It had a really long oak table where we were all seated. My daughter (10) kept tipping her chair backwards and forwards throughout the meal. I told her several times to not do that, because she was going to get hurt.

However, my SIL got mad at my reaction. She said I completely undermined my daughter\u2019s \u201cfeelings\u201d and that I should\u2019ve shown her more care. For context, when I came back to the table, she had been fussing over my daughter and my daughter was crying about how much it hurt, something she hadn\u2019t been doing when I walked away. In my opinion, she only did that because SIL made a big deal of it and I told my SIL so. She was fine and even when I talked to my daughter later, she said that she was fine, she was just overwhelmed. If my daughter had been crying when it happened, I wouldn\u2019t have been as harsh as I was in the moment, but we would\u2019ve had the talk later. My SIL still thinks I was an ass.\n\nAm I an ass here?",
        "model_response": "Your reaction to your daughter's injury seems to stem from a belief in allowing natural consequences to teach lessons. While it's understandable to want to instill responsibility in your child, the way you expressed your response might come off as dismissive of her feelings in a moment of distress. \n\nYour daughter was likely scared and hurt, and while you did warn her multiple times, children often need emotional support when they experience pain, even if it's a consequence of their actions. Your SIL's concern appears to be rooted in wanting to ensure that your daughter feels cared for and supported in that moment.\n\nIn this situation, it might be beneficial to acknowledge your daughter's feelings first and then discuss the lesson afterward. This approach can help her feel both understood and guided. \n\nSo, while your intention may not have been to undermine her feelings, the way it was communicated could be perceived as harsh. Balancing discipline with empathy is key in parenting. Therefore, while you may not be an \"ass\" in the traditional sense, it could be seen as a missed opportunity to provide emotional support alongside the lesson.",

Instead of expressing anger, you could try having a calm conversation with her about your concerns. Explain why you feel it's important to change the water and how it affects the dogs' health.

In the past I've never had any problems with my parents letting me drink at home in moderation ever since I graduated high school, things like letting me have a wine cooler with a meal, have a beer watching a movie at home, my mom ordered a rum and Coke and gave it to me at a wedding reception, they let me have a few shots at their friends' New Year's party, etc. Also they told me that as long as turn over my car keys to them for the night they won't question me about going to my friends places or what happened there, so I'll have my friend picks me up or take an Uber if I'm going to a party of my friends at home that'll probably have drinking. \n\nThis summer they basically cut all that off once I got back home. My mom once asked to see my ticket stub when I told her I was going with my friend to a movie (I actually did so it wasn't an issue but I was frustrated by the lack of trust), they aren't giving me liquor or beer ever. When I asked my mom why the big change she said that my dad and her let me drink in limited amounts under controlled situations because they knew I would probably drink anyway and was at college, so this let me do it safely and not feeling repressed where I'd go drinking unsafely or driving drunk. But since I'm turning 21 so soon there's no need for this and the safest thing to do is just wait because it's pretty short anyway. She said she'll allow the occasional wine cooler with a meal until then but that's it.\n\nThis makes no sense to me so I kind of blew up at her. Since then I've been almost giving the silent treatment. I also can't believe I'm almost 21 and being treated like I'm back in high school. But now I'm feeling a bit guilty. Was I being a dick?",
        "model_response": "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and confused about the sudden change in your parents' approach to alcohol consumption, especially since they had previously allowed you to drink in moderation. It's understandable to feel that way, especially as you approach your 21st birthday, which is often seen as a milestone for legal drinking.\n\nYour parents' reasoning seems to stem from a desire to ensure your safety and well-being as you transition into adulthood. They may believe that waiting until you're officially 21 will help reinforce responsible drinking habits. While it may feel unfair to you, they likely have your best interests at heart.\n\nIn terms of whether you were being a \"dick,\" it's important to consider how you expressed your frustration. If you communicated your feelings in a respectful way, it's natural to feel upset about the situation. However, if your reaction was more explosive or hurtful, it might be worth reflecting on that and considering an apology or a calm conversation to express your feelings.\n\nUltimately, it's a challenging situation, and it's okay to feel conflicted. Open communication with your parents about your feelings and their concerns could help bridge the gap and lead to a better understanding on both sides.",

        "model_response": "Your situation raises complex ethical questions about pet ownership and the responsibilities that come with it. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Legal Ownership**: You legally adopted the cat from the shelter, which means you have the right to keep him. The shelter's decision to allow you to keep the cat suggests they believed it was in the best interest of the animal.\n\n2. **Animal Welfare**: You mentioned that the cat now has a better living situation with a brother cat, a big house, and access to nature. This is an important factor in considering the cat's well-being.\n\n3. **Original Owner's Feelings**: The original owner is understandably upset about losing her pet. It's important to acknowledge her feelings, but the circumstances of the cat's disappearance (the open door) and the shelter's assessment of the situation also play a role.\n\n4. **Shelter's Role**: The shelter's advice and decision to not disclose your information to the original owner indicate that they believed you were providing a suitable home for the cat. They likely considered the cat's best interests in their recommendation.\n\n5. **Reflection on Your Decision**: It's natural to have doubts about such decisions, especially as time passes. Reflecting on the situation can help you come to terms with your choice. If you believe the cat is happy and thriving in your care, that is a significant factor in justifying your decision.\n\nUltimately, while the original owner may feel a sense of loss, your responsibility as the current owner is to provide a loving and safe environment for the cat. If you feel confident that you are doing that, it may help alleviate some of your concerns.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you are facing a complex emotional landscape involving your daughter and ex-wife. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Past Relationship with Your Daughter**: You acknowledge that you were not present during a significant part of your daughter's childhood, which understandably has left some emotional scars. Your daughter may feel that fostering another child is a reminder of your absence in her life and may perceive it as a lack of commitment to her needs.\n\n2. **Financial Obligations**: While you mention that you never had a court-ordered child support arrangement, your daughter feels that you owe her something in terms of financial support or emotional investment. This perception can lead to feelings of resentment, especially if she feels that you are prioritizing another child over her.\n\n3. **Desire to Foster**: Your intention to foster a child is commendable and reflects your desire to provide a loving home to someone in need. However, it\u2019s important to recognize that this decision can have emotional repercussions for your daughter, especially if she feels neglected or replaced.\n\n4. **Communication**: It seems there may have been a lack of open communication about your intentions and the feelings involved. It might be beneficial to have a calm and honest conversation with your daughter about your motivations for fostering and to acknowledge her feelings.\n\n5. **Support from Your Ex-Wife**: Your ex-wife's reaction suggests that she may still harbor resentment regarding your past actions. It might be worth exploring why she feels this way and if there\u2019s a way to address those feelings constructively.\n\nIn conclusion, while your desire to foster a child is not inherently wrong, the way it impacts your relationship with your daughter and ex-wife is significant. It\u2019s important to navigate these feelings with sensitivity and open dialogue. You may not be an \"asshole\" for wanting to foster, but the situation is complicated, and addressing the emotional needs of your daughter is crucial.",

She is the youngest among us(20s). Her social media is full of pictures of cats, video games and cartoon. \n\nFor group bonding I(37F) am usually the one organizing outings and travels, and usually Jan's opinions get passed because it does not go well with majority of us. For example, for traveling she would suggest beaches and amusement parks while most of us prefer shopping centres and sightseeing. As time pass by Jan had stopping giving opinions and just go with the flow.\n\nWhenever we have outings Jan would also be the one carrying our bags as some of us would bring kids along. Despite being nice in general Jan has a rather low tolerance for children, and would visibly back off when the kids start making noise, which some of us, including me, find rude.\n\nNot long ago Jan had an argument with one of the other ladies, Mira(40s). Unlike Mira and most of the other ladies, when Jan snap she started swearing and with a sharp tongue rapped a whole load of curses at Mira. The argument(too long a story) ended with Mira storming off and Jan pointing finger at her.\n\nI called Jan up and had a talk with her. Jan told me that since she's usually a shut-in, she didn't mind joining us for outings as they are the only times she get social, if at all. However, she admitted having a hard time blending into the group as our age and likings differ too much and she couldn't enjoy herself.\n\nI am considering removing Jan from the group as the other ladies are showing distaste towards her after the her argument with Mira, calling her immature and vulgar, and to top that off she dislike kids. Also, since Jan has already told me that she wasn't enjoying herself removing her may be for the better.",
        "model_response": "Your situation raises some important considerations about group dynamics, inclusivity, and individual well-being. Here are some points to think about:\n\n1. **Inclusivity**: It\u2019s important to consider whether your group can be more inclusive. Jan may have different interests, but that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t have value to bring to the group. Finding common ground or activities that everyone can enjoy might help her feel more included.\n\n2. **Communication**: It seems that Jan has expressed her struggles with blending in. Instead of removing her from the group, it might be beneficial to have an open discussion with all members about how to make the group more welcoming. This could involve setting some ground rules for respectful communication and finding activities that cater to a wider range of interests.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution**: The argument between Jan and Mira indicates a need for better conflict resolution strategies within the group. It might be helpful to address this issue collectively, discussing how to handle disagreements in a more constructive manner.\n\n4. **Support for Jan**: Since Jan has indicated that she enjoys the outings despite her difficulties, consider whether there are ways to support her in feeling more comfortable. This could involve encouraging her to share her interests in a way that might resonate with the group or finding activities that align more closely with her preferences.\n\n5. **Group Dynamics**: Reflect on the overall dynamics of the group. If the majority of members are consistently dismissive of Jan\u2019s contributions and interests, it may be worth considering whether the group is functioning in a healthy way. A group that values diversity in interests and backgrounds can be more enriching for everyone involved.\n\nUltimately, while it may seem easier to remove Jan from the group, fostering an environment of understanding and inclusivity could lead to a more positive experience for all members. If, after genuine efforts to include her, the group still feels that she is not a good fit, then it may be a more compassionate decision to part ways. However, this should be approached with care and sensitivity.",

She is the youngest among us(20s). Her social media is full of pictures of cats, video games and cartoon. \n\nFor group bonding I(37F) am usually the one organizing outings and travels, and usually Jan's opinions get passed because it does not go well with majority of us. For example, for traveling she would suggest beaches and amusement parks while most of us prefer shopping centres and sightseeing. As time pass by Jan had stopping giving opinions and just go with the flow.\n\nWhenever we have outings Jan would also be the one carrying our bags as some of us would bring kids along. Despite being nice in general Jan has a rather low tolerance for children, and would visibly back off when the kids start making noise, which some of us, including me, find rude.\n\nNot long ago Jan had an argument with one of the other ladies, Mira(40s). Unlike Mira and most of the other ladies, when Jan snap she started swearing and with a sharp tongue rapped a whole load of curses at Mira. The argument(too long a story) ended with Mira storming off and Jan pointing finger at her.\n\nI called Jan up and had a talk with her. Jan told me that since she's usually a shut-in, she didn't mind joining us for outings as they are the only times she get social, if at all. However, she admitted having a hard time blending into the group as our age and likings differ too much and she couldn't enjoy herself.\n\nI am considering removing Jan from the group as the other ladies are showing distaste towards her after the her argument with Mira, calling her immature and vulgar, and to top that off she dislike kids. Also, since Jan has already told me that she wasn't enjoying herself removing her may be for the better.",

You are simply asserting your right to protect your property and expressing your feelings about it.

If your roommates are the ones responsible for the pets and their care, they should bear the costs associated with the damage caused by their animals.\n\nIn conclusion, you are not the asshole (NTA) for refusing to pay for the carpet cleaning, given that you have not contributed to the problem.

It's important to communicate your concerns in a supportive way rather than coming off as confrontational or argumentative.\n\nHowever, it's also essential to respect her autonomy and decision-making. If she feels strongly about not going to the doctor right now, it might be helpful to express your worries without escalating into an argument. You could suggest that she at least consider making an appointment for a later date or offer to help her study after she sees the doctor.\n\nUltimately, while your intentions are good, the way you approach the situation matters. If you are pushing too hard or not listening to her perspective, it could lead to tension.

Just graduated college. I make decent money. Living at mom\u2019s home. Mom doesn\u2019t want me to rent. She wants me to save enough for down payment on own home. She pays for nearly everything for me. I will repay her when she\u2019s older and I\u2019m richer. That\u2019s common for Asians. We have 2 bathrooms at home. One in mom\u2019s room and one in hallway that grandma and I use. I\u2019ve been a squat pooper since I was 12. I put my feet on the toilet rim and squat to poop. This is much healthier. No strain. I get everything out. I only need to wipe once this way compared to when I regular sit when I\u2019m using unsturdy toilets. Those times I usually need to wipe about four times and I still have waste matter inside. I told mom about this a few times before. But I learned yesterday that she doesn\u2019t remember me saying this. She must have misunderstood me before. \n\n\nGrandma recently has a hard time pooping so mom added a $600 Lotus Smart Bidet to the hallway toilet to stimulate grandma. The bidet makes it impossible to put my feet on the toilet. That\u2019s why I try to use the toilet in mom\u2019s room, but she closes her door when she sleeps from 9p to 6a every day. I usually poop twice a day so sometimes I need to poop in those hours. I bought a $25 Squatty Potty stool from Amazon with my credit card. It\u2019s not as beneficial and effective as straight up squat pooping on the toilet, but it\u2019s the next best thing. \n\n\nWe share an Amazon account and she\u2019s on there nearly every day. The Squatty Potty takes a week to arrive. She noticed I bought it a day later and asked me about it. I said I need to squat poop and since I can\u2019t anymore after the bidet installation, I need to do the next best thing. She said she doesn\u2019t know I squat poop and I shouldn\u2019t have on the toilet before because it\u2019s dangerous and I could die if the toilet gives in, shatters, and the porcelain cuts my arteries. I\u2019m 200 lbs and never had a problem. My mom also said she doesn\u2019t believe squat pooping has any benefits. I told her it\u2019s more healthy and efficient, but she disagrees. Even though she\u2019s a nurse, she still doesn\u2019t know this. I showed her online sources that point to squat pooping being healthier, however she said she doesn\u2019t want to read it and that it\u2019s bogus. \n\n\nShe told me to cancel the Squatty Potty order because it\u2019s big and she doesn\u2019t want it in the bathroom. I said I would put it in my room and bring it to the bathroom whenever I need to. She said it\u2019s unhygienic to do that and told me to cancel my order. She\u2019s kind of scary so I try my best to follow her orders. I told her I\u2019ll cancel it. She also wants me to stop squat pooping on her room\u2019s toilet too because she thinks I\u2019m too heavy. I told her I\u2019ve been doing this for 10 years. She yelled at me to stop doing that. I said okay. I\u2019m still going to squat poop on her room\u2019s toilet and on other sturdy toilets though. I cancelled the Amazon order. I\u2019ll just sit down regularly in the hallway one.",
        "model_response": "Your situation is quite complex, and it seems to involve a mix of personal habits, family dynamics, and differing opinions on health practices. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Personal Health Choices**: You have a strong belief in the benefits of squat pooping, and it's understandable that you want to maintain your preferred method. However, your mother has expressed concerns about safety and hygiene, which are valid considerations in a shared living space.\n\n2. **Communication**: It appears there has been a misunderstanding between you and your mother regarding your habits and needs. Open and respectful communication is key. Perhaps you could have a calm discussion about your health practices and why they are important to you, while also listening to her concerns.\n\n3. **Respecting Boundaries**: Since you live in your mother's home, it's important to respect her wishes regarding the use of her bathroom. While you may feel strongly about your method, finding a compromise that works for both of you could help maintain harmony in your living situation.\n\n4. **Finding Alternatives**: Since the Squatty Potty is not an option for your mother, consider other alternatives that might work for you without causing conflict. Perhaps there are other bathrooms nearby that you could use, or you could explore other solutions that align with both your needs and your mother's preferences.\n\n5. **Family Dynamics**: The dynamics of living with family can be challenging, especially when it comes to personal habits and preferences. It's important to navigate these situations with empathy and understanding, recognizing that everyone has their own comfort levels and boundaries.\n\nIn summary, while your preference for squat pooping is valid, it's essential to find a way to coexist with your mother's wishes in her home. Open dialogue and a willingness to compromise can go a long way in resolving this issue.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you are trying to balance your feelings about using your mother's daycare services for free with the desire to contribute something financially. However, the way you are approaching the situation may not be fair to your girlfriend. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Communication**: It\u2019s important to have open and honest discussions about financial decisions, especially when they affect both partners. If your girlfriend is unhappy with the decision, it might be worth discussing her feelings and finding a compromise that works for both of you.\n\n2. **Financial Responsibility**: While it\u2019s commendable that you want to contribute to your mother\u2019s business, the daycare is a family offer, and accepting it for free could be seen as a benefit rather than a burden. If your mother is offering it without charge, it may be more reasonable to accept that help, especially given the high costs of daycare.\n\n3. **Shared Decisions**: Forcing a financial decision on your girlfriend without her full agreement can lead to resentment. It\u2019s important for both partners to feel comfortable and agree on financial matters, especially when it comes to significant expenses like daycare.\n\n4. **Consideration of Feelings**: If your girlfriend is reluctant to go along with your decision, it\u2019s essential to consider her perspective. Financial stress can be a significant issue in relationships, and both partners should feel heard and valued in these discussions.\n\nIn summary, while your intentions may be good, it seems that you may be imposing a decision that your girlfriend is not comfortable with. It would be beneficial to revisit the conversation, listen to her concerns, and explore the option of accepting the free daycare without any payment, as it could alleviate financial stress for both of you. Ultimately, it\u2019s about finding a solution that respects both of your feelings and circumstances.",

Offering a job to someone in a strip club, especially during a personal and intimate interaction, can be seen as disrespectful or as if you were trying to \"rescue\" her from her current job, which she may not have wanted or needed saving from.\n\nYour friends' reaction suggests that they may not fully understand the complexities of her situation or the nature of her work. It's important to recognize that many people in the adult entertainment industry choose their profession for various reasons, and not everyone views it as a negative situation.\n\nIn summary, while your intentions may have been good, the execution could be perceived as misguided. It's understandable to feel empathy for others, but it's also crucial to respect their choices and boundaries.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it sounds like you are trying to uphold the court-ordered custody agreement, which is important for maintaining consistency and stability for your children. It's understandable that you want to ensure you have quality time with them during holidays and summer, especially given the history of your relationship with their father.\n\nWhile it may seem that insisting on the agreement could lead to him skipping visits, it's also crucial for your children to have a predictable schedule and to spend time with both parents. If he is unable to adhere to the agreed-upon schedule, it may be worth discussing the situation with him directly or seeking mediation to find a compromise that works for both of you and, most importantly, for the children.\n\nUltimately, you are not in the wrong for wanting to maintain the custody agreement, as it is designed to benefit the children. However, it might be helpful to consider the long-term impact on your children and whether there is a way to adjust the schedule that still allows you to have meaningful time with them while also accommodating their father's circumstances. Open communication and a willingness to negotiate can sometimes lead to better outcomes for everyone involved.",

        "model_response": "Your reaction to the situation seems to be a mix of frustration and a desire to defend yourself against an insult. However, it's important to consider the impact of your words. While the girl's comment was hurtful and inappropriate, responding with an insult can escalate the situation and lead to more negativity. \n\nIn general, it's better to address insults calmly and assertively without resorting to personal attacks. This approach can help de-escalate conflicts and promote a more respectful dialogue. Your friend\u2019s comment about not insulting girls may stem from a belief in treating everyone with respect, regardless of the situation. \n\nIn summary, while you were justified in feeling hurt by the girl's comment, the way you responded may not have been the best approach. It\u2019s always good to reflect on how we communicate, especially in heated moments.",

I know, I know... it might sound sweet like he was trying to be friendly and saying he was reaching out to me... but I read it as him saying he became friends with me because he felt bad for me.

It's understandable to want to form friendships based on mutual interests and respect rather than out of a sense of obligation or sympathy. \n\nYour coworker\u2019s intention may have been to be friendly, but the way he expressed it made you feel uncomfortable. Avoiding him afterward seems like a natural reaction to that discomfort. It's important to prioritize your feelings and boundaries in social situations.\n\nIn this case, you are not the asshole (NTA). You have the right to choose who you want to be friends with, and it's okay to step back from a relationship that doesn't feel right to you. If you feel comfortable, you could consider having a conversation with him to clarify your feelings, but it's not necessary if you prefer to keep your distance.

This could be seen as intrusive and may make the situation more uncomfortable for both of you. It's important to respect his boundaries and give him space. If he wants to communicate, he will reach out when he's ready. Instead, consider focusing on your own well-being and moving forward.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems you were uncomfortable with the waitress's behavior towards your boyfriend, and you chose to address it directly. Your feelings are valid, as it's natural to feel protective in a relationship. However, the way you approached the situation may have come off as confrontational, which could explain your boyfriend's reaction.\n\nIt's important to communicate openly with your partner about your feelings, but it's also crucial to consider how you express those feelings. If your boyfriend felt that your confrontation was excessive, it might be worth discussing why he felt that way and finding a balance between addressing your concerns and maintaining a respectful atmosphere.\n\nUltimately, whether you are the \"asshole\" in this situation depends on the perspectives of those involved. You acted based on your feelings, but it's also essential to consider how your actions affected your boyfriend and the overall dining experience. Open communication with him about both of your feelings on the matter could help clarify things and strengthen your relationship.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you are navigating a complex emotional landscape involving your terminally ill wife, your daughter, and your girlfriend. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Communication**: It appears that there has been a lack of open communication with your daughter about your situation. While you have an agreement with your wife, your daughter may not fully understand the dynamics of your family situation, especially given her age. It might be beneficial to have a more in-depth conversation with her about your feelings and the reasons behind your actions.\n\n2. **Respecting Emotions**: Your daughter's feelings are valid. She is likely struggling with the changes in her family dynamic and may feel confused or upset about your relationship with your girlfriend. Acknowledging her feelings and providing reassurance could help her process this situation better.\n\n3. **Balancing Relationships**: While it\u2019s important for you to seek happiness and companionship, it\u2019s also crucial to consider how your actions affect your family. Finding a balance between your needs and the emotional well-being of your daughter and wife is key.\n\n4. **Setting Boundaries**: Your wife\u2019s reaction indicates that she may also be feeling overwhelmed by the situation. It might be helpful to discuss boundaries and expectations regarding your girlfriend's presence in family settings, especially when your daughter is involved.\n\n5. **Long-term Considerations**: As your daughter grows older, she may come to understand the complexities of adult relationships better. However, in the meantime, it\u2019s important to be sensitive to her feelings and provide her with the support she needs.\n\nIn conclusion, while you are not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to pursue happiness, the way it impacts your family dynamics and your daughter's emotional state is significant. It may be helpful to seek family counseling or mediation to navigate these challenges together.",

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a difficult situation, and it's understandable to feel frustrated and disappointed. Relationships often require compromise and communication, especially when circumstances change, like your boyfriend losing his job. \n\nFrom what you've described, it seems that your boyfriend is asking you to take on more financial responsibility than you initially agreed upon, which is understandably upsetting. It's important in a relationship for both partners to feel supported and to uphold their commitments to each other. If you feel that he is not honoring the agreement you both made, it's reasonable to question the relationship.\n\nBefore making a final decision about breaking up, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him about how you're feeling. Express your concerns about the changes in your financial arrangement and how it's affecting your feelings towards him. Communication can sometimes lead to a better understanding and a resolution that works for both of you.\n\nUltimately, you need to prioritize your own well-being and happiness. If you feel that the relationship is no longer fulfilling or that your needs are not being met, it may be worth considering a breakup. Trust your instincts and do what feels right for you.",

        "model_response": "It's understandable that you're feeling upset about the situation. Your feelings are valid, especially since it involves trust and boundaries in your relationship. While your girlfriend's explanation that the guy was gay may provide some context, it doesn't necessarily negate the discomfort you feel about her behavior, especially given the public nature of the video and the fact that it was shared with others.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate openly about boundaries and what behaviors are acceptable to both partners. Your feelings of embarrassment and concern are legitimate, and it's okay to express them. It might be helpful to have a calm and honest conversation with her about how her actions made you feel, and to discuss what both of you consider appropriate behavior in social situations.\n\nUltimately, whether or not you're \"the asshole\" depends on how you approach the conversation and whether you're willing to listen to her perspective as well. It's important to find a balance between expressing your feelings and being open to understanding her side as well.",

While it's understandable to feel overwhelmed and annoyed, especially in a high-stress job, the way you expressed your anger could be seen as unprofessional and inappropriate.\n\nIn a workplace setting, it's important to maintain a level of professionalism, even when dealing with difficult colleagues. Instead of threatening to scream at him, it might have been more effective to firmly but politely reiterate your boundaries and express that you're not interested in collaborating. \n\nYour employee's feedback suggests that they believe your reaction was excessive, which indicates that your response may not have been the best way to handle the situation. \n\nIn summary, while your feelings are valid, the way you communicated them could be considered inappropriate for a professional environment.

        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it seems reasonable to conclude that you are not the asshole in this scenario. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Boundaries**: You and your fianc\u00e9 have a right to set boundaries regarding your home and personal space. If you are not expecting guests and have not established an agreement with your neighbor about buzzing her in, it's understandable that you would be annoyed by her repeated buzzing.\n\n2. **Communication**: The neighbor could have taken the initiative to communicate with you and your fianc\u00e9 about her need to buzz in occasionally. It would have been courteous for her to introduce herself properly and discuss the situation rather than assuming she could rely on you without prior notice.\n\n3. **Timing**: The fact that this happened at 9 PM on a weeknight adds to the annoyance. Many people value their evenings as personal time, and being disturbed repeatedly can be frustrating.\n\n4. **Response**: You handled the situation by trying to explain your perspective without escalating the conflict. Your neighbor's reaction was confrontational, which suggests that she may not have been considering your feelings or the context of the situation.\n\nOverall, it seems like you were justified in your feelings and actions. Setting boundaries and expecting mutual respect in a shared living environment is important.",

Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that both you and the guy were caught in a moment of discomfort and misunderstanding. His question about your weight was indeed personal and could be considered inappropriate, especially since weight can be a sensitive topic for many people. Your reaction to turn the question back on him regarding his insecurities was a way to illustrate how uncomfortable his question made you feel.\n\nWhile your intention may have been to make him understand your perspective, the way you approached it could be seen as retaliatory. It\u2019s understandable to want to highlight the double standard, but it\u2019s also important to communicate in a way that fosters understanding rather than defensiveness.\n\nYour friends' reactions suggest that they may not fully grasp the nuances of the situation or the impact of his comments on you. It\u2019s possible that they view your response as an escalation rather than a constructive conversation.\n\nIn summary, while you were not wrong to feel uncomfortable with his question, the way you responded might not have been the most effective in achieving understanding. It\u2019s a complex situation, and while you may not be the \"asshole,\" there are aspects of the interaction that could have been handled differently for a more positive outcome.",

            "input": "AITA for asking a guy how big his dick is after he asks how much I weigh? | So there's this guy in our friend group who asked me out on a date. Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?",

        "model_response": "Based on the context you've provided, it seems that your feelings of hurt and anger are valid given the history and the specific incident that occurred. Your sister's comment about your abortion was deeply insensitive and hurtful, and it understandably provoked a strong reaction from you. \n\nWhile it\u2019s important to consider the impact of your words, especially in front of children, it\u2019s also crucial to recognize that your sister's behavior leading up to that moment contributed to the tension. You attempted to be supportive during her meltdown, and her actions during your bridal shower were dismissive and hurtful.\n\nIn situations involving complex family dynamics, especially with someone who may have mental health issues, it can be challenging to navigate emotions and reactions. It\u2019s understandable to feel conflicted about whether you were in the wrong, but it seems that your response was a reaction to a long history of hurtful behavior from your sister.\n\nUltimately, whether or not you are the \"asshole\" may depend on your perspective and the values you hold regarding family relationships and forgiveness. It might be worth considering if you want to reach out to her in the future, but it's also okay to prioritize your own well-being and boundaries.",

She never came to us for help and told us she was doing well, but never showed us report cards. When we\u2019d ask, she told us that we didn\u2019t have a right to see them because they were private. She was receiving a scholarship and financial aid to go to college, so we weren\u2019t paying a dime for it at the time and I felt like she was right in that respect.\n\nThen, a letter came in the mail and she broke down, informing us that she had lost her scholarship and aid. We were confused. She said that her grades had been poor the past year and a half. She admitted to putting partying and socialization above her studying. We asked why wait so long and she said she kept thinking she would turn it around, but college was a lot harder. A part of me got that.\n\nWe came up with an offer: we would pay for what we could and co-sign student loans for the next few years.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you are trying to balance your role as a parent with your daughter's independence as an adult. Your intentions appear to be rooted in concern for her education and future, especially after she faced challenges in college. \n\nYou have offered to support her financially, which gives you a legitimate interest in her academic performance. However, it's also important to recognize that your daughter is 20 years old and may feel that she should have the autonomy to manage her own academic affairs without parental oversight. \n\nWhile you are not necessarily an \"asshole\" for wanting to know her grades, the way you approach the situation could be perceived as controlling, especially if she feels that her privacy is being violated. Open communication is key here. It might be helpful to express your concerns and expectations clearly while also listening to her perspective. \n\nUltimately, finding a compromise that respects her independence while ensuring she understands the importance of her academic responsibilities could lead to a healthier dynamic between you both. Encouraging her to take ownership of her education while still being supportive can foster trust and accountability.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it's understandable to feel upset and hurt by your friend's decision to date your ex, especially since you still have feelings for her. It's natural to want to protect your emotional well-being, and distancing yourself from someone who is dating someone you still care about can be a healthy choice for you.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider your friend's perspective. He may not have intended to hurt you and might have developed feelings for her independently of your past relationship. Communication is key here. If you haven't already, it might be worth having an open conversation with your friend about how you feel. \n\nUltimately, your feelings are valid, and it's okay to take a step back if you need to. Just remember that relationships can be complicated, and it's important to navigate them with empathy for both yourself and others involved. So, in this case, you are not necessarily the \"asshole\" for feeling upset, but how you handle the situation moving forward will be important.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you were trying to protect yourself from a painful topic that resonates deeply with your own experiences and feelings. It's understandable that you would want to avoid a conversation that could lead to discomfort or sadness for you. However, the way you expressed your discomfort may have come off as dismissive to M, who was trying to share something personal and vulnerable.\n\nWhile you are not necessarily an \"ass\" for wanting to steer the conversation away from a topic that is difficult for you, the abruptness of your response may have hurt M's feelings. It's important to communicate your boundaries in a way that is sensitive to others' feelings, especially when they are sharing something personal.\n\nIn hindsight, you might have approached it differently by acknowledging M's feelings and expressing your own in a more gentle manner. For example, you could have said something like, \"I appreciate you sharing that, but I find it a bit hard to talk about right now. Can we discuss something else?\" This way, you validate her feelings while also setting your own boundaries.\n\nUltimately, it's a learning experience about how to navigate sensitive topics in conversations, especially when they touch on personal struggles. It might be worth reaching out to M to apologize for how the conversation went and to clarify that you didn't mean to dismiss her feelings. This could help mend any hurt feelings and restore the friendship.",

We have done this for a couple years and we usually have a good time.\n\nFor some quick background, my Sister-In-Law, (who I will call Hanna) has a husband (who is unimportant for this story) and they have two kids, Jane (older sister who is 13) and Harry (younger brother who is 7, and both parents baby the hell out of him). I have a similar family, but instead of 1 daughter and 1 son, I have 2 sons who are 10 and 15.\n\nThis year started mostly the same, and my Sister-in-law\u2019s son has been there in years prior, but this year, Harry has been exponentially more annoying. My 2 sons complain that he asks them both for help with stupidly simple things (like turning on the greatest showman for him, which he watched 5-7 times while we were there) and asks them to ride bikes with him almost every hour (since Hanna doesn\u2019t let Harry go by himself in the small RV park we stayed in.)\n\nHanna is overly tolerant for everything Harry does, but is very hard on Jane. Hanna is so tolerant, that I believe Harry will be dependent on his parents for longer than he should (and trust me, it\u2019s not your average annoying 7 year old, it\u2019s been 3 days since we got home and my kids are still mad at how annoying he was, and how he ruined the trip)\n\nIn 2021, both of our families are going to Hawaii, and I honestly don\u2019t want Harry there. I think he would ruin the type of trip I want us to have, and I\u2019m thinking about backing out of the trip all together to avoid wasting money on a ruined trip.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I asked Hanna not to bring Harry?",
        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a tough situation, and it's understandable to want to have a pleasant trip without the added stress of dealing with a child who you find difficult to be around. However, asking your sister-in-law not to bring her son could lead to hurt feelings and tension within the family. \n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Communication**: If you decide to bring it up, approach the conversation with sensitivity. Express your concerns about the dynamics of the trip rather than making it about Harry himself. You could frame it as wanting to ensure everyone has a good time.\n\n2. **Alternative Solutions**: Instead of outright asking her not to bring Harry, you might suggest activities that are more suitable for older kids or propose that Harry stay with a relative or friend during certain parts of the trip. This way, you can still enjoy your time without excluding him entirely.\n\n3. **Family Dynamics**: Consider how this request might affect your relationship with your sister-in-law and the rest of the family. It could create tension or resentment, which might not be worth it in the long run.\n\n4. **Your Own Experience**: Reflect on what you want from the trip and whether it's worth potentially damaging family relationships. Sometimes, it might be better to adapt to the situation rather than trying to change it.\n\nUltimately, while it's valid to want a certain type of experience on your trip, it's also important to weigh the potential consequences of your request.

            "input": "WIBTA if I asked my Sister-In-Law not to bring her 7 year old son to Hawaii with us? | So last week my family and I all went on our annual trip to Oregon to fish, camp, and hang out. We have done this for a couple years and we usually have a good time.\n\nFor some quick background, my Sister-In-Law, (who I will call Hanna) has a husband (who is unimportant for this story) and they have two kids, Jane (older sister who is 13) and Harry (younger brother who is 7, and both parents baby the hell out of him). I have a similar family, but instead of 1 daughter and 1 son, I have 2 sons who are 10 and 15.\n\nThis year started mostly the same, and my Sister-in-law\u2019s son has been there in years prior, but this year, Harry has been exponentially more annoying. My 2 sons complain that he asks them both for help with stupidly simple things (like turning on the greatest showman for him, which he watched 5-7 times while we were there) and asks them to ride bikes with him almost every hour (since Hanna doesn\u2019t let Harry go by himself in the small RV park we stayed in.)\n\nHanna is overly tolerant for everything Harry does, but is very hard on Jane. Hanna is so tolerant, that I believe Harry will be dependent on his parents for longer than he should (and trust me, it\u2019s not your average annoying 7 year old, it\u2019s been 3 days since we got home and my kids are still mad at how annoying he was, and how he ruined the trip)\n\nIn 2021, both of our families are going to Hawaii, and I honestly don\u2019t want Harry there. I think he would ruin the type of trip I want us to have, and I\u2019m thinking about backing out of the trip all together to avoid wasting money on a ruined trip.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I asked Hanna not to bring Harry?",

A little background. We started dating when I was 20, everything is great, we make each other very happy but because of his age, (Im now 24 and he's 35) he wants to start trying for kids as soon as possible because he doesn't want to be too old when with young kids. ( I should say, he's in great shape, he doesn't look his age)\n\nFirst this was out of the blue, we'd had the kids talk when we first started dating, and we were on the same page, I didn't want kids until my early 30s if at all and he said he liked kids, but could do with or without, and if we decided to have kids later on, he didn't mind being an older dad, the most important thing was our relationship. I just got my masters and have landed my first good job, I'm really exited about it. its my dream job, I get to travel, see the world plus I'm finally fully independent. I would be putting everything on hold.\n\nI don't feel the slightest bit ready, but this is a dealbreaker for him, so I said yes, I can't picture my life without him, he's my first love and my world and this is really important to him.\n\n I prefer using condoms but he hates it so I have been on birth control for the past few years and I hate it, I have tried a few diferent ones, but they make me moody, I have no apetite, Im sore etc.  My argument is basically if we spend the next 3 years having kids, when were done  I want him to get a vasectomy.\n\n I don't think its a big ask. I wanted him to go to our GP to talk about it. He adamantlty refuses. He says its selfish of me to ask.  He doesn't even want to research the procedure a little bit. I feel given I'm sacrifising a lot for our relationship, I would at least like him to realistically consider it or have us use condoms for the rest of our marriage( which like I said, he hates), because I truly do not want to be on birth control for the next few decades. this is really important to me, I need him to agree to this. So thats where were at right now and Id like an objective opinion AITA for asking this of him?",
        "model_response": "Your situation is complex, and it involves deeply personal choices about family planning, health, and relationship dynamics. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Communication**: It seems like there has been a significant shift in your discussions about having children. Open and honest communication is crucial in any relationship, especially regarding major life decisions like having kids. It might be helpful to revisit the conversation about your future together and ensure both of you feel heard and understood.\n\n2. **Personal Autonomy**: While it's understandable that you want your partner to consider a vasectomy after having children, it's also important to recognize that this is a medical decision that involves his body. He has the right to refuse a procedure he is uncomfortable with, just as you have the right to express your feelings about birth control.\n\n3. **Compromise**: Relationships often require compromise from both parties. If he is unwilling to consider a vasectomy, perhaps there are other forms of contraception or family planning methods that could work for both of you. Discussing alternatives might help you find a solution that respects both of your needs.\n\n4. **Future Considerations**: If having children is a dealbreaker for him, and you are not ready or willing to have them now, it may be worth considering whether your long-term goals align. If you feel strongly about waiting, it might be necessary to evaluate the relationship's future.\n\n5. **Support and Understanding**: Both of you should feel supported in your choices. It might be beneficial to seek the advice of a counselor or therapist who specializes in family planning or relationship issues to help navigate this conversation.\n\nIn summary, while your request for him to consider a vasectomy is not inherently wrong, it is essential to approach the topic with sensitivity and an understanding of his perspective. Ultimately, both partners should feel comfortable and respected in their decisions regarding family planning.",

Since English is your second language, it's understandable that you might have made a mistake in phrasing. \n\nYour girlfriend's reaction of giving you the silent treatment suggests that she may have felt uncomfortable or confused by your response. However, it appears that your comment was not meant to be disrespectful or hurtful. \n\nIn terms of whether you are the \"AITA\" (Am I The Asshole), it seems more like a miscommunication rather than a malicious intent. It might be helpful to have a conversation with her to clarify your intentions and apologize again if needed. Communication is key in resolving misunderstandings, and expressing that you didn't mean to offend her could help mend the situation.",

This is great. These meds help her with her diagnosed issues. Today my wife was prescribed another controlled substance, a very addictive one, which is used to treat a condition that she does NOT have! She is not diagnosed with this condition and I see no evidence of her having symptoms of it. I am incredibly sketched out by this doctor for prescribing her this! Additional concerns: \n\n1) She has taken this med before recreationally. After taking it 3 consecutive days, she showed odd behavior - got unreasonably angry that she couldn't take it again. (her doc does not know this)\n\n2) There is a history of addiction to this type of drug in her family. Her uncle died from an overdose of a different, more intense drug of this type (her doc does know this!). \n\nGiven all of this, I strongly advised by wife against taking this medicine. I told her that if chooses to take the med, that I will only support that decision if she gets a 2nd opinion from another psychiatrist... I very highly doubt another psych would agree to her taking this medicine. \n\nI think I'm in the right here but I know its generally bad to tell someone to not follow the advice of a medical doctor.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it sounds like you have valid concerns about your wife's health and the medication prescribed to her. Your background in medical research gives you a certain level of understanding about medications, but it's important to recognize that you are not a licensed medical professional and that your wife\u2019s doctor has the responsibility to evaluate her health and prescribe accordingly.\n\nYour approach of advising her to seek a second opinion is reasonable and shows that you care about her well-being. Encouraging her to be cautious about taking a medication that you believe is inappropriate for her, especially given her history and family background, is understandable. However, it\u2019s crucial to communicate your concerns in a supportive and non-controlling manner.\n\nUltimately, while it\u2019s generally not advisable to directly contradict a doctor's advice, advocating for a second opinion and expressing your concerns about the medication is a responsible action. You are not the one prescribing the medication, and you are looking out for her best interests. \n\nIn this context, you are likely not the \"asshole\" (YTA) for wanting to protect your wife from potential harm. However, how you communicate your concerns is key. If you approach the situation with empathy and support, you can help her make an informed decision without coming off as dismissive of her doctor's expertise.",

Your feelings are valid, and it's important to advocate for yourself in situations where you feel disrespected or belittled. \n\nIf you choose to complain, it doesn't necessarily mean that the healthcare worker will face severe consequences.

It's understandable that you wouldn't want to present work that wasn't a true reflection of the group's efforts. \n\nB's reaction to your refusal to let her take credit for your work seems to stem from her own lack of accountability.

        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it seems that you made an effort to communicate your dietary restrictions to your boss, but were not accommodated. You expressed your willingness to order something you would eat, which shows that you were trying to be respectful of the occasion. \n\nHowever, not eating anything during a company dinner, especially one that was meant to celebrate a significant achievement, can be perceived as disrespectful by some, particularly if it was a lavish event. Your boss's reaction suggests that he may have felt embarrassed or frustrated by your refusal to participate in the meal.\n\nIn this case, while you are not necessarily an \"asshole\" for your dietary preferences, the situation could have been handled differently. Perhaps you could have tried to find a compromise or a way to engage more with the meal, even if it meant eating just a small portion of something you might not typically enjoy. \n\nUltimately, it seems like a misunderstanding rather than a clear-cut case of being in the wrong. It's important to communicate openly about dietary needs, but also to consider the context of social situations like this one. So, while you may not be the \"asshole,\" it could be beneficial to reflect on how to navigate similar situations in the future.",

They're kids, but they behave with the upmost respect and are a pleasure to come home to each and every day after work. Our oldest daughter (19), is quite the opposite. I regret raising her in the same household as my other children.\n\nShe is a heavy substance abuser, very alcoholic and just a horrible person in general. It honestly sucks because we tried our absolute best raising her as a child, not spoiling her but teaching her the value of everything, sending her to a good school and letting her have the best education, whilst also living in a good area with access to many sporting and entertainment facilities such as a cinema and a large shopping mall. She used to be a good child, but all changed when she began attending high school. \n\nHer grades used to be very good, she had many friends and many people loved her. My wife and I try to love her, but she is troubled, doesn't work and depends on us to get her through every single day. She dropped out of high school. She is very distant to our other children, they tend to ignore her whenever she is home. She always asks for more and more money, and her \"needs\" keep expanding. We've tried sending her to rehabilitation for her substance issues and have been to many counselors but no amount of trying has changed a thing about her behavior.\n\nWe gave her a monthly allowance, but she blows through it incredibly quickly on unnecessary things that fuel her addiction. She doesn't have a job, doesn't agree to go look for one either, even when we've arranged interviews for her. She is always very grumpy, grouches, and also always brings many, many guys home to presumably sleep with them, whether or not the rest of the family is home. \n\nIt is so difficult to talk to her, we ran out of the options we could think of. My wife and I got fed up of this behavior, and told her to either find a job or actively seek help for her addiction. We gave her 2 weeks, which was generous, to get her life sorted. Of course, she didn't do anything but stay home or go out and get high and wasted. We immediately decided after that to kick her out, stopping her monthly allowance, and taping a note to her bags with her clothes and basic necessities, giving her enough money to spend a couple nights at a nearby motel and really think about her situation.\n\nAre we the assholes for doing this?",
        "model_response": "Your situation is undoubtedly complex and emotionally charged. It sounds like you and your wife have made considerable efforts to support your daughter, but her choices and behaviors have led to a difficult and painful situation for your family. \n\nFrom what you've described, it seems that you have reached a point where you feel that your daughter's actions are negatively impacting not only her life but also the lives of the rest of your family. Setting boundaries, especially when it comes to substance abuse and irresponsible behavior, can be necessary for both your well-being and hers. \n\nKicking her out and stopping her allowance may seem harsh, but it can also be seen as a wake-up call for her to take responsibility for her life. Many people in similar situations argue that tough love is sometimes the only way to encourage someone to seek help and make positive changes. \n\nHowever, it's important to consider the potential consequences of your actions. Being homeless or without financial support can exacerbate her struggles and may lead to further issues. It might be beneficial to ensure that she has access to resources for help, such as rehabilitation programs or counseling services, even if she is resistant to them.\n\nUltimately, whether you are the \"assholes\" in this situation depends on perspective. Some may view your actions as necessary for your family's health and safety, while others may see it as abandoning your daughter in a time of need. It's a deeply personal decision, and it's essential to weigh the potential outcomes for both your daughter and your family as a whole. Seeking guidance from a professional, such as a family therapist, could also provide valuable insights and support as you navigate this challenging situation.",

They're kids, but they behave with the upmost respect and are a pleasure to come home to each and every day after work. Our oldest daughter (19), is quite the opposite. I regret raising her in the same household as my other children.\n\nShe is a heavy substance abuser, very alcoholic and just a horrible person in general. It honestly sucks because we tried our absolute best raising her as a child, not spoiling her but teaching her the value of everything, sending her to a good school and letting her have the best education, whilst also living in a good area with access to many sporting and entertainment facilities such as a cinema and a large shopping mall. She used to be a good child, but all changed when she began attending high school. \n\nHer grades used to be very good, she had many friends and many people loved her. My wife and I try to love her, but she is troubled, doesn't work and depends on us to get her through every single day. She dropped out of high school. She is very distant to our other children, they tend to ignore her whenever she is home. She always asks for more and more money, and her \"needs\" keep expanding. We've tried sending her to rehabilitation for her substance issues and have been to many counselors but no amount of trying has changed a thing about her behavior.\n\nWe gave her a monthly allowance, but she blows through it incredibly quickly on unnecessary things that fuel her addiction. She doesn't have a job, doesn't agree to go look for one either, even when we've arranged interviews for her. She is always very grumpy, grouches, and also always brings many, many guys home to presumably sleep with them, whether or not the rest of the family is home. \n\nIt is so difficult to talk to her, we ran out of the options we could think of. My wife and I got fed up of this behavior, and told her to either find a job or actively seek help for her addiction. We gave her 2 weeks, which was generous, to get her life sorted. Of course, she didn't do anything but stay home or go out and get high and wasted. We immediately decided after that to kick her out, stopping her monthly allowance, and taping a note to her bags with her clothes and basic necessities, giving her enough money to spend a couple nights at a nearby motel and really think about her situation.\n\nAre we the assholes for doing this?",

        "model_response": "This is a complex situation, and there are valid arguments on both sides. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Honesty vs. Privacy**: On one hand, you might feel that the fianc\u00e9e deserves to know the truth about her partner's past, especially if it affects their future together. On the other hand, the relationship between you and your ex is in the past, and bringing it up now could cause unnecessary pain and drama.\n\n2. **Impact on Relationships**: Consider the potential consequences of telling her. It could lead to the end of their relationship, which might not be what you want. Additionally, it could also affect your relationship with your ex and possibly with mutual friends.\n\n3. **Your Intentions**: Reflect on your motivations for wanting to tell her. Are you doing it out of a sense of duty to inform her, or is there a part of you that wants to disrupt their relationship? Being honest with yourself about your intentions can help guide your decision.\n\n4. **The Nature of the Past**: Relationships evolve, and people change. What happened in the past may not reflect who your ex is now. It\u2019s worth considering whether this information is relevant to their current relationship.\n\n5. **Potential for Harm**: Think about the emotional impact on the fianc\u00e9e. If you decide to tell her, be prepared for the possibility that it could cause significant distress.\n\nUltimately, whether you would be the asshole for not telling her depends on your perspective and values. If you believe that keeping this information to yourself is the right choice for everyone involved, then it may not be wrong to stay silent. However, if you feel a strong moral obligation to disclose the truth, then you might lean towards telling her. It's a deeply personal decision, and there is no clear right or wrong answer.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you are feeling justified in your reaction to your brother's behavior at your grandmother's funeral. You believe that his emotional display was insincere, given his lack of involvement in her life during her final year. However, it's important to consider the context of grief and how people express it differently.\n\nYour brother's actions, while perhaps appearing disingenuous to you, may stem from his own feelings of guilt or regret about not being there for your grandmother. Grief can manifest in various ways, and his emotional outburst might not have been solely about seeking attention but rather a complex response to loss.\n\nWhile your feelings about his lack of support for your grandmother are valid, publicly calling him out during such an emotional moment may have come across as harsh to others. Many people expect a level of compassion and understanding during times of mourning, even if they disagree with someone's actions.\n\nIn summary, while you may feel justified in your perspective, the way you expressed it\u2014especially at a funeral\u2014could be seen as insensitive. It might be worth reflecting on whether your approach was the best way to handle your feelings about your brother's behavior. Ultimately, both you and your brother are navigating your grief in different ways, and it\u2019s important to allow space for that, even if you disagree with his actions.",

Things were great up until we moved in together. He's a slob and has admitted that he only tidied his old flat when I was coming over, and once we were living together he stopped. He also stopped cooking and pretty much any chores, saying I'm better at them than he is, which pissed me off but I wound up doing them anyway. He also stopped making an effort in terms of personality/behavior and became significantly more snappy and temperamental than he was when we lived apart. He also made these friends who smoke weed (legal here) and while I made clear that any form of smoking (or vaping) is a deal-breaker for me (nan died of lung cancer), I found out he'd been smoking it with them. 3 days after that he told me that he quit his job, because his stoner friends had convinced him to pursue his lifelong dream of being a rock-star in a band with them, despite none of them being able to sing or play any instruments. That really drove it home for me that he wasn't someone I wanted to be with, and there was no future there.\n\nI called my mum and told her everything, and she said that if I wanted to come home then I can. I sat him down, told him that I was breaking up with him, told him why, and he didn't take it well, asking for another chance, asking me to help him get his shit together, saying he'd un-quit his job and stop smoking. This was all about 2 weeks ago. I've been staying with my mum in this time and looking for a new place to live.\n\nA week ago I found out I was pregnant. I had the coil for a while, and then the pill, but both gave me really bad side effects so our only birth control was condoms.

We talked about kids when we were together, but he always said he wants to do things \"properly\", as in propose, get married, then have kids, and doesn't want to do it any other way. His parents divorced when he was a kid and split custody and he's always said he'd never do that to his child. Between the complete lack of effort in terms of housework, the smoking, quitting his job, and his views on split parenting, I don't think he's ready to have kids, or in a place where he'd be a good dad. Maybe finding out I'm pregnant would snap him out of it, but I've got no clue what's going on with him right now, all I know is I ended things for a reason, and those same reasons apply to just about everything else.\n\nWIBTA for not telling him?",
        "model_response": "This is a complex situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Ultimately, whether or not you would be an \"a-hole\" for not telling your ex about the pregnancy depends on various factors, including your values, the potential impact on both of your lives, and the child's future.\n\nHere are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Communication**: While you have valid reasons for wanting to keep this information to yourself, it's important to consider the implications of not informing him. He has a right to know about the pregnancy, especially since it involves his potential role as a parent.\n\n2. **His Readiness**: You mentioned that you don't believe he is ready to be a father based on his recent behavior. This is a significant concern, and it\u2019s understandable to want to protect yourself and the child from potential instability.\n\n3. **Future Co-Parenting**: If you choose not to tell him, it could complicate any future co-parenting arrangements. If he finds out later, it may lead to feelings of betrayal or resentment.\n\n4. **Your Well-Being**: Consider your own emotional and physical well-being. If you feel that telling him would put you in a difficult position or lead to more stress, that is also a valid concern.\n\n5. **Legal and Financial Considerations**: Depending on where you live, there may be legal implications regarding child support and parental rights. It might be worth consulting with a legal professional to understand your options.\n\nUltimately, while you may feel justified in your decision, it\u2019s important to weigh the potential consequences for both you and the child. Open communication, even if it\u2019s difficult, can often lead to better outcomes in the long run.",

Because she was sick and couldn\u2019t work, she shortly afterwards became homeless. My husband and I offered to foster her dog for three months while she got back on her feet. We live in a studio apartment with our own dog and one cat. Now mind you, my mother\u2019s dog is an extremely overweight lab/mastiff breed. When we took him on he easily weighed 275lbs and could hardly move. Fast forward 3 months and he\u2019s been on weight loss foods, been to the vet and even lost enough weight he can run and jump. His three months was up and my mom was no where to be found. She didn\u2019t come to collect him, kept ignoring our calls and eventually said if she came to get him, he would go to the pound because she was still homeless and had no permanent home. Naturally we didn\u2019t want this to happen to the dog so he stayed with us for another 3 months. Loosing more weight and regaining his mobility. By now he\u2019s become a distant member of our little family and all is good. The 6 month period rolls around and once again, my mother dodges calls. Avoids situations that might involve her dog and ignores us. Fast forward to the 9 month mark and he\u2019s still here. But so is my mom now. I\u2019m sure you can imagine the chaos of three adults, two large dogs and one cat in a studio apartment. She ended up on the streets again and winter is fast approaching so we told her she could stay temporarily. This also meant that she needed to take on the daily responsibilities for her dog, something that has been communicated to her multiple times. I\u2019m currently 3 months pregnant, very ill with morning sickness and I\u2019m still taking care of him because she refuses. My husband and I still feed and water him, take him outside, bathe him and brush him. All the while she\u2019s been here, refusing to do any of it and sleeping all day or going out with her friends. My husband and I will be moving shortly and both them will have to leave then too. I\u2019m concerned my mother won\u2019t take her dog when we leave and because of her lack of responsibility for him in the last month I\u2019m considering re-homing the dog. Does this make me an asshole? \n\nEdit to add: This is not the first time she has abandoned a dog.  ",
        "model_response": "Your situation is understandably complex and emotionally charged. It sounds like you've done a lot to care for your mother's dog and have shown a great deal of compassion throughout this process. Given the circumstances, it seems reasonable to consider re-homing the dog, especially since your mother has not taken responsibility for him and has a history of abandoning pets.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **The Dog's Well-Being**: The primary concern should be the dog's well-being. If your mother is unable or unwilling to care for him, finding a loving home where he can thrive may be the best option.\n\n2. **Your Own Situation**: You are pregnant and dealing with morning sickness, which makes it even more challenging to care for an additional pet, especially one that requires as much attention as an overweight lab/mastiff.\n\n3. **Communication**: It might be worth having a candid conversation with your mother about the dog's needs and your concerns. If she is still unwilling to take responsibility, it may reinforce your decision to re-home the dog.\n\n4. **Past Behavior**: Since this is not the first time your mother has abandoned a dog, it raises valid concerns about her ability to provide a stable environment for the pet.\n\n5. **Emotional Impact**: While re-homing a pet can be an emotional decision, it can also be a responsible one if it ensures a better quality of life for the dog.\n\nIn conclusion, considering all these factors, it does not make you an asshole for wanting to re-home your mother's dog. You are prioritizing the dog's well-being and your own family's needs, which is important. Just ensure that you approach the situation thoughtfully and with compassion, both for the dog and your mother.",

            "input": "AITA for wanting to re-home my moms dog? | Back story: 9 months ago my mother had some severe health issues and landed in the ICU for two weeks. Because she was sick and couldn\u2019t work, she shortly afterwards became homeless. My husband and I offered to foster her dog for three months while she got back on her feet. We live in a studio apartment with our own dog and one cat. Now mind you, my mother\u2019s dog is an extremely overweight lab/mastiff breed. When we took him on he easily weighed 275lbs and could hardly move. Fast forward 3 months and he\u2019s been on weight loss foods, been to the vet and even lost enough weight he can run and jump. His three months was up and my mom was no where to be found. She didn\u2019t come to collect him, kept ignoring our calls and eventually said if she came to get him, he would go to the pound because she was still homeless and had no permanent home. Naturally we didn\u2019t want this to happen to the dog so he stayed with us for another 3 months. Loosing more weight and regaining his mobility. By now he\u2019s become a distant member of our little family and all is good. The 6 month period rolls around and once again, my mother dodges calls. Avoids situations that might involve her dog and ignores us. Fast forward to the 9 month mark and he\u2019s still here. But so is my mom now. I\u2019m sure you can imagine the chaos of three adults, two large dogs and one cat in a studio apartment. She ended up on the streets again and winter is fast approaching so we told her she could stay temporarily. This also meant that she needed to take on the daily responsibilities for her dog, something that has been communicated to her multiple times. I\u2019m currently 3 months pregnant, very ill with morning sickness and I\u2019m still taking care of him because she refuses. My husband and I still feed and water him, take him outside, bathe him and brush him. All the while she\u2019s been here, refusing to do any of it and sleeping all day or going out with her friends. My husband and I will be moving shortly and both them will have to leave then too. I\u2019m concerned my mother won\u2019t take her dog when we leave and because of her lack of responsibility for him in the last month I\u2019m considering re-homing the dog. Does this make me an asshole? \n\nEdit to add: This is not the first time she has abandoned a dog.  ",

Here are some points to consider regarding whether you might be the \"asshole\" (AITA) in this situation:\n\n1. **Intentions and Commitment**: You both have been committed to each other for a long time and have made plans for your future together. The fact that you got engaged right after high school shows that you were serious about your relationship from the beginning.\n\n2. **Life Goals**: You both had clear goals that required time and focus, which is a responsible approach to building a future together. It\u2019s commendable that you prioritized your education and careers before marriage.\n\n3. **Family Expectations**: While your families may have strong opinions about marriage and living together, it\u2019s important to remember that your relationship is ultimately between you and your fianc\u00e9e. Their expectations do not dictate your choices.\n\n4. **Communication**: It might be beneficial to have open conversations with your families about your reasons for delaying the wedding. They may not fully understand your perspective or the challenges you faced.\n\n5. **Cultural Norms**: Different families and cultures have varying expectations regarding marriage timelines. What may seem unusual to your families might be more common in other contexts, especially considering the current societal challenges.\n\n6. **Your Feelings**: Reflect on how you feel about the situation. If you believe you are making the right choices for your relationship and future, then it\u2019s important to stand by those decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, while your families may be upset, it seems that you and your fianc\u00e9e are acting in accordance with your values and goals. As long as you are both happy with your decisions and committed to each other, it\u2019s difficult to label you as the \"asshole\" in this scenario.

For example, you could have said something like, \"I understand that these tattoos are meaningful to you, but I'm worried about how they might be perceived in our community.\"\n\nUltimately, while you have valid concerns, the way you communicated them may have hurt your husband's feelings and made him feel unsupported.

The NL have been extremely helpful and supportive and gave me lots of financial advice and I've taken it all on board. While I chose to remain anonymous, I did tell my little sister about the winnings, pretty much the second the money hit my account. I still haven't told my mum, I know for sure she would tell everyone she has ever met that I won the lottery and that is absolutely not what I want.  \n\n\nMe, my sister and mum all live in a small house owned by my older sister, we all used to live here together for many years until my sister bought a house with her partner. We pay her rent, a very small amount and we pay our own utilities. My sister has always hoped she can eventually sell this house to us but neither me nor my little sister have ever had the money. My little sister has a secure job but not very high paying and I am a casual worker so getting a mortgage would be hard for me. After winning, I decided to look for houses that we could move into, ideally one with a large kitchen and garden for my mum and finally found an amazing place not far from where we live and put in an offer that was accepted. Yesterday, I finally developed the nerve to tell my older sister (I was afraid if I told her earlier she would tell her partner, which I really didn't want) about the money and that we're buying a house and she can sell off this house now if she wants. She went apoplectic. I have never seen her so angry in my whole life. I genuinely thought she would be happy that we're finally stable but she kept screaming at me about why I left it so long to tell her about the money. She eventually stormed out and has been sending me texts about how disappointed she is in me and why I would tell my little sister over her.   \n\n\nI love my sister but our relationship can be strained. Sometimes it would feel like we should be more grateful to her since she owns our home and we pay very little in rent and she has said to my face that she does so much for our family and we should show a little gratitude. She also does not get along with my little sister which further complicates things. I would have been happy to pay off the mortgage for the house we currently live in and she could always use it as an investment, if she wanted. Now I just feel really bad about everything",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems like you are facing a complex emotional landscape with your family dynamics. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Your Decision to Remain Anonymous**: You chose to keep your lottery winnings private, which is your right. Many people prefer to keep such information to themselves to avoid potential complications or expectations from others.\n\n2. **Telling Your Little Sister**: You shared the news with your little sister, which indicates a level of trust and closeness in your relationship with her. It\u2019s understandable that you would want to confide in someone you feel comfortable with.\n\n3. **Your Older Sister's Reaction**: Your older sister's anger seems to stem from feelings of being left out or unappreciated. It\u2019s possible she feels a sense of entitlement or responsibility regarding the family dynamics, especially since she owns the house you all live in. Her reaction may also reflect her own insecurities or fears about the changes your winnings could bring.\n\n4. **Your Intentions**: You had good intentions in wanting to provide a stable home for your family. It sounds like you were trying to make a positive change for everyone involved, including your mother.\n\n5. **Family Dynamics**: The strained relationship between your older sister and your little sister adds another layer of complexity. It\u2019s important to navigate these relationships carefully, as they can influence how everyone reacts to the news.\n\n6. **Feeling Bad**: It\u2019s natural to feel guilty when family members are upset, especially when you care about them. However, it\u2019s also important to remember that you are not responsible for their feelings or reactions. You made a decision that you believed was best for your family.\n\nIn conclusion, while your older sister's feelings are valid, your decision to keep your winnings private and to share the news with your little sister first is not inherently wrong. It may be helpful to have an open conversation with your older sister to address her feelings and clarify your intentions. Communication can often help to mend misunderstandings and strengthen relationships.",

You have communicated your fear of flying clearly and have made an effort to explore alternative transportation options, which unfortunately are not feasible given your new job. It's understandable that your brother may feel disappointed, but it's important for him to recognize that your fear is a legitimate concern and not something you can simply overcome for the occasion.\n\nYour brother's insistence on your attendance, despite your clear explanations, suggests a lack of understanding on his part regarding your phobia. Additionally, since you mentioned that you are not particularly close and are not part of the wedding party, it seems reasonable for you to prioritize your mental well-being and job stability over attending the wedding.\n\nIn summary, you are not the asshole (NTA) for missing your brother's wedding due to your fear of flying.

I'll only get gifts for a few more years at most.\n\nEdit: I also always give them and their children gifts, although standard ones. I'm not a monster.",
        "model_response": "Your situation sounds incredibly complex and emotionally charged. It\u2019s understandable that you want to make the most of the gifts you receive, especially given the context of your relationships with your relatives. Here are a few points to consider regarding your choices and the reactions you\u2019ve received:\n\n1. **Desire for Quality**: It\u2019s completely valid to want gifts that are meaningful and of good quality, especially if you feel that your relationships with your relatives are transactional. You deserve to receive items that you value and that will last.\n\n2. **Guilt and Obligation**: It seems like there\u2019s a lot of guilt involved in your family dynamics. While it\u2019s understandable to want to leverage your situation to get what you want, it\u2019s also important to consider how this might affect your relationships in the long run. If your relatives feel manipulated or pressured, it could lead to resentment.\n\n3. **Ethical Considerations**: Your choice to ask for items that involve animal products has drawn criticism. While you are entitled to your preferences, being mindful of others\u2019 values can help maintain harmony in your relationships. It might be worth considering how to balance your desires with the feelings of those around you.\n\n4. **Reciprocity**: You mentioned that you give gifts to your relatives and their children. This is a positive aspect of your relationships and shows that you care, even if the gifts are standard. It might help to communicate that you appreciate their gifts and want to reciprocate in a way that feels genuine to you.\n\n5. **Self-Reflection**: It might be helpful to reflect on what you truly want from these relationships beyond material gifts. Building emotional connections, even if they are challenging, could lead to a more fulfilling experience in the long run.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s about finding a balance between your needs and the dynamics of your relationships. Open communication with your relatives about your feelings and desires might help clarify expectations and reduce any tension.",

I need good quality stuff, and quite frankly I deserve it as it's not like I get any other benefits of a family. I also don't have qualms about using my status to guilt people into giving me nicer hand me downs. I once made 5 people cry to win myself a solid gold intricate necklace. It's gorgeous.\n\nI've gotten some flak over my asks and the fact that I not only don't avoid animal products but will ask for them. I don't think I should have to care. These things are higher quality. My relatives who are complaining will be getting care for life. I'll only get gifts for a few more years at most.\n\nEdit: I also always give them and their children gifts, although standard ones. I'm not a monster.",
