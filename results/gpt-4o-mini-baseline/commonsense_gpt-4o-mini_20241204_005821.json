        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a difficult situation, and it's understandable that you want to protect yourself and your brother from potential negative experiences during family gatherings. Your concerns about your mother's drinking and its impact on her behavior are valid, especially given your past experiences.\n\nHere are a few thoughts on how to approach this situation:\n\n1. **Open Communication**: If you feel comfortable, consider having an open and honest conversation with your mother before the Christmas dinner. Express your concerns about her drinking and how it affects you. You might frame it in a way that emphasizes your care for her and your desire for a positive family gathering.\n\n2. **Set Boundaries**: It's okay to set boundaries for yourself. If you feel that you can only enjoy the dinner without alcohol present, it's reasonable to communicate that. You could suggest a \"no alcohol\" policy for the gathering, framing it as a way to ensure everyone has a good time.\n\n3. **Support from Family**: If your brother and partners share your concerns, it might be helpful to approach the situation as a united front. Discussing it together can lend more weight to your feelings and make it easier to express your wishes to your mother.\n\n4. **Alternative Activities**: Suggest activities that don't revolve around drinking, such as games, movies, or other festive traditions. This can help shift the focus away from alcohol and create a more enjoyable atmosphere.\n\n5. **Plan for Support**: If your mother does choose to drink, have a plan in place for how you and your brother will handle the situation. This could involve having a safe space to retreat to or a designated person to help manage the situation if it escalates.\n\nUltimately, it's important to prioritize your well-being and comfort. While it may feel unkind to make demands, your feelings are valid, and it's okay to advocate for a healthier environment during family gatherings.",

        "model_response": "It's understandable that you care about your friend's well-being and are concerned about Amanda's health. However, discussing someone's weight, especially in the context of a relationship, can be a sensitive topic and may lead to unintended consequences. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Approach with Care**: If you decide to talk to Bryan, frame the conversation around concern for Amanda's overall well-being rather than focusing solely on her weight. Emphasize your care for both of them and your desire to see them healthy and happy.\n\n2. **Consider Their Relationship**: Remember that Amanda is an adult capable of making her own choices. It's important to respect her autonomy. If she is happy in her relationship, that should be a priority.\n\n3. **Focus on Health, Not Appearance**: If you bring up the topic, try to steer the conversation towards healthy habits and lifestyle choices rather than weight. Discussing the importance of a balanced diet and exercise can be more constructive.\n\n4. **Be Prepared for Pushback**: Understand that Bryan may not react positively to your concerns. He might feel defensive or dismissive, which could strain your friendship.\n\n5. **Support Amanda Directly**: If you feel comfortable, consider reaching out to Amanda directly. Offer support and encourage her to engage in healthy activities, but do so in a way that feels supportive rather than judgmental.\n\nUltimately, it's a delicate situation, and you should weigh the potential risks and benefits of intervening. Your intentions are good, but it's essential to approach the matter thoughtfully and respectfully.",

        "model_response": "Your intention seems to have been to teach your children a lesson about empathy and respect for others, which is commendable. However, the act of pointing at someone, especially in a sensitive context like this, can come across as disrespectful or hurtful, regardless of your intentions. \n\nIt's understandable that you were trying to help your children understand a concept, but the execution could have been better. Instead of pointing, you might have used a more discreet way to guide their attention, such as gently directing their gaze without singling the person out. \n\nIt's important to acknowledge how your actions may have affected the individual and their family. While it was not your intention to be hurtful, it's okay to feel remorseful about how it came across. Use this experience as a learning opportunity for both yourself and your children about how to approach sensitive topics with kindness and respect. \n\nIn summary, while your intentions were good, the method you chose was not appropriate. It's a moment to reflect on and learn from, rather than something to beat yourself up over. Apologizing to the individual, if possible, could also help in addressing the situation.",

The most he will do is unload the dishwasher when told to do so.  He sleeps all day and only comes down from his room for meals.  I feel that it's important to say that he has high-functioning asperger's but that only affects his social skills.\n\nAnyways, I get yelled at by my mother if I sleep in, if I stay up too late, if I don't prove to her my homework is done, etc.  My brother doesn't get reprimanded for anything he does or doesn't do.  I have been fed up lately from having to live at home (I usually live in an apartment near my college), and this treatment hasn't made it any better.  \n\nSo, today I had enough of this and called my mom out for letting my brother be lazy all day and not getting any sort of reprimand.  I asked her if he knows how to cook anything other than pasta, she said no.  I asked if he knew how to make his bed, she said no.

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a really tough situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. From what you've described, it seems like you're expressing valid concerns about the unequal treatment between you and your brother, especially regarding household responsibilities and expectations. \n\nYour feelings about being held to a higher standard while your brother is not are completely valid, and it's natural to want to address that imbalance. It\u2019s also important to recognize that your brother's high-functioning Asperger's may influence how your parents perceive his capabilities, but that doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t be encouraged to learn basic life skills.\n\nIn calling out your mom, you were advocating for yourself and expressing your concerns about your brother's lack of independence. It\u2019s important to communicate openly about these feelings, even if it leads to conflict. However, the way you approach the conversation can make a big difference. If it came off as confrontational, it might have put your mom on the defensive, making it harder for her to hear your perspective.\n\nUltimately, it seems like you are not the asshole for wanting to address this issue. You deserve to be treated fairly and to have your concerns acknowledged. It might be helpful to have a calm conversation with your mom about how you feel and to suggest ways that your brother can start taking on more responsibilities, while also acknowledging the challenges he faces. Finding a balance that respects both your needs and your brother's situation could lead to a more harmonious living environment for everyone involved.",

The most he will do is unload the dishwasher when told to do so.  He sleeps all day and only comes down from his room for meals.  I feel that it's important to say that he has high-functioning asperger's but that only affects his social skills.\n\nAnyways, I get yelled at by my mother if I sleep in, if I stay up too late, if I don't prove to her my homework is done, etc.  My brother doesn't get reprimanded for anything he does or doesn't do.  I have been fed up lately from having to live at home (I usually live in an apartment near my college), and this treatment hasn't made it any better.  \n\nSo, today I had enough of this and called my mom out for letting my brother be lazy all day and not getting any sort of reprimand.

The thing is that Gray isn't a bad person, she just gets on my nerves so I kept my distance as much as possible.\n\nAt the end of the semester people started looking for new roommates and a lot of my friends came up to me to ask me what living with Gray was like and I was honest and told them about all the little things that she does that bothered me, personally.

        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it seems that you are grappling with the ethics of sharing your experiences with Gray and how it may impact her relationships with others. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Honesty vs. Fairness**: While it's understandable that you want to be honest about your experiences with Gray, it's also important to consider the potential consequences of your words. Sharing your feelings about her may lead to others forming negative opinions without getting to know her themselves.\n\n2. **Boundaries**: You mentioned that Gray had boundary issues, and it seems like you are now facing a similar dilemma. It's important to respect her right to be seen as she is, rather than through the lens of your frustrations. \n\n3. **Impact on Relationships**: If your comments are causing others to avoid Gray, it could be seen as unfair, especially if they might have had a different experience with her. Everyone deserves a chance to be judged on their own merits.\n\n4. **Self-Reflection**: It might be helpful to reflect on why you feel compelled to share your experiences. Is it to vent your frustrations, or do you genuinely believe you are helping others? Understanding your motivations can guide your future interactions.\n\n5. **Consideration for Others**: If you feel that your comments are negatively impacting Gray's opportunities for friendships or connections, it may be worth reconsidering how you discuss her. You could choose to keep your opinions to yourself or frame them in a way that acknowledges her positive traits as well.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's natural to share your experiences, it's also important to be mindful of how those experiences affect others. If you feel that your comments are unfairly influencing others' perceptions of Gray, it may be best to keep your thoughts to yourself moving forward. So, in this case, you might be leaning towards being the \"not the asshole\" (NTA) if you choose to stop sharing negative comments about her, as it shows growth and consideration for others.",

I met his son when he was 5 years old, he's 7 now. His son, who I will call Josh, was very open and warm to me in the beginning. My fiance was never the best at being a dad to him, but when I came in the picture we changed that. I made sure we had meals together when I was around and we went on trips to the zoo and museum frequently. I would make sure they had \"Josh and Dad\" days, and I would often take him out by myself to arcades or the pool. Everything was going well, but I always noticed defiance in Josh. He fights everything. He lies about everything. His mom says he's 100x worse at her house, and I know there is some tension in their home so I expected that.\n\nJosh is very destructive, more than the average 7 year old I believe. I invited my fiance to come live with me after about a year of dating. I have two extra rooms so I figured we could fix one up for Josh. Josh comes over every weekend, and every weekend piece of my furniture is either broken completely or destroyed in some way (colored on, buttons ripped off, holes poked or cut in things). When confronted about these things he will lie and lie even if we caught him in the act. Josh will steal from his friends, from his school, and from us. Josh stole $100 from my purse last week when his dad confronted him he said \"Well, if I can't have it, you can't either!\" And ripped the bill in half.\n\nJosh is violent, I have had to put all his play guns/swords too high for him to reach because when he has them he shoots people in the face or beats them with his swords. We had my grandparents over for dinner one time and he managed to get his guns and shoot them in the face during dinner. He is often screaming that he wants to kill things. My dog is currently staying at my mother's because when Josh comes over he will lock the dog in the bathroom or outside for hours on end. Josh would chase my dog with big sticks and everytime he walked in the door my (usually very friendly) dog would run away or pee. \n\nMy fiance and I recently found out I was pregnant. Josh acted out tremendously when he was told. I ended up losing the baby 3 months in and Josh was so happy about this... Often telling me \"I'm glad the baby died. I don't want any siblings.\" Or \"It's good that your body can't make babies right. I hate babies.\" This was basically the breaking point for me. We have tried tough love, open arms, therapy, all of it. Nothing seems to change or get through to this boy. I understand he's 7 and coming from a broken home is always damaging. But, at the end of the day he's not biologically mine and I have been feeling more and more disconnected and really feel no love for him at this point. Not only is it unfair for me, but it's unfair for my fiance AND his son. It's exhausting and fills me with anxiety whenever my husband leaves to pick him up. I feel like I hold my breath all weekend. \n\nI would never make ANYONE choose between their child and their SO. And even if I did, I would be disappointed if someone chose their SO over their kid. I think I need to leave, I don't think I have the emotional capacity to stay and deal with it. I want nice things again, I want my dog, I want to have kids someday. AITA?",
        "model_response": "Your situation is undoubtedly complex and emotionally charged. It sounds like you've put a lot of effort into building a relationship with your fianc\u00e9 and his son, but the challenges you're facing with Josh are significant and understandably distressing. \n\nIt's important to recognize that you are not responsible for Josh's behavior, and it's clear that you've tried various approaches to address the issues.

It's also commendable that you recognize the difficulty of making someone choose between their child and a partner; that shows a level of empathy and understanding.\n\nIn summary, while it may feel difficult to make this decision, prioritizing your own needs and mental health is not wrong.

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a challenging situation, and it's understandable to feel uncomfortable about being monitored in a shared living space. Here are some points to consider when deciding whether to approach your boss about the camera:\n\n1. **Privacy Concerns**: It's reasonable to expect a certain level of privacy in a shared living space, especially in areas where you might be relaxing or having personal conversations. If the camera is making you uncomfortable, it's valid to express that concern.\n\n2. **Company Policy**: Check if there are any written policies regarding surveillance in the intern housing. If there are guidelines that suggest transparency about monitoring, you could reference those when discussing your concerns.\n\n3. **Approach**: If you decide to speak to your boss, consider framing your request in a way that emphasizes your feelings rather than making accusations. For example, you could say, \"I've noticed the camera is active, and it's making me feel uncomfortable. Is there a way we could discuss the purpose of the camera and possibly consider disabling it?\"\n\n4. **Potential Reactions**: Be prepared for a range of responses. Your boss may be understanding, or they may feel defensive. Think about how you would handle different outcomes.\n\n5. **Alternative Solutions**: If your boss is unwilling to disable the camera, consider discussing ways to ensure your privacy, such as setting boundaries for when the camera is active or discussing what is being monitored.\n\nUltimately, whether or not you choose to bring this up depends on your comfort level and the dynamics of your workplace. If you feel strongly about it, advocating for your privacy is important, but be mindful of how you approach the conversation.",

It's held on the same weekend every year, and MIL expects all of her kids to come (it's basically 2nd Christmas at this point). It has only changed weekends a couple of times in the last 2 decades, causing chaos, sooo they don't change it idly. Also of important note, MIL organises and purchases everything, then divides the cost by person and each family reimburses her for their portion. No one has a problem doing this, including us. \n\nI love this trip. I look forward to it every year, because it's often the only vacation hubby and I get. This year however, the camping trip weekend falls 6wks after my due date. \n\nI made an idle comment to MIL a couple weeks before Christmas about us planning on coming, and massively looking forward to it, while simultaneously hoping that I'll feel up to us coming...basically a hope and plan for the best but mentally prepare for the worst type conversation.\n\nShe became visibly irate, and asked WHY I thought we might not come.\n\n....b-because I will have very recently pushed a squashed watermelon out of my baby purse (or if I'm unlucky had my abdomen carved open, rifled through, then slapped back together like a Thanksgiving turkey) and I physically might be in extreme discomfort or pain, rendering the idea of being in an unpredictable, \"rustic\" environment with shared (and probably less-than-sanitary) facilities entirely unappealing?\n\nShe made a face and didn't say anything else about it, but a couple weeks later at Christmas, hubby and I's Christmas gift was a homemade gift certificate explaining that our family's camping expenses were prepaid in full. \n\nI mentioned to hubby that I was SUPER APPRECIATIVE of this gesture, but that I simultaneously feel that she's manipulating me into a position of not being able to say \"no\" to coming on the camping trip, which I dislike. He was irritated with me for seeing ulterior motives in his mom's generosity.\n\nTL;DR - I tell MIL we *might* not be coming on a traditional yearly camping trip due to my having given birth just weeks prior, she responds by paying for our portion of expenses...I feel she's manipulating me/us into coming, hubby feels I'm being ungrateful and petty. AITA?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that your feelings are valid, and it's understandable to feel a bit manipulated given the circumstances. Your mother-in-law's gesture of prepaying for the camping trip could be seen as a way to encourage you to attend, especially since she reacted strongly to the idea that you might not come. \n\nIt's important to communicate openly with your husband about your feelings. You appreciate the gesture but also feel pressured by it. It might help to express that you want to make the best decision for your health and well-being after giving birth, and that you hope he can understand your perspective.\n\nUltimately, you are not an asshole for feeling the way you do. It's a complex situation where both your feelings and your mother-in-law's intentions can coexist. It's about finding a balance between family traditions and your own needs during a significant life change.",

This year however, the camping trip weekend falls 6wks after my due date. \n\nI made an idle comment to MIL a couple weeks before Christmas about us planning on coming, and massively looking forward to it, while simultaneously hoping that I'll feel up to us coming...basically a hope and plan for the best but mentally prepare for the worst type conversation.\n\nShe became visibly irate, and asked WHY I thought we might not come.\n\n....b-because I will have very recently pushed a squashed watermelon out of my baby purse (or if I'm unlucky had my abdomen carved open, rifled through, then slapped back together like a Thanksgiving turkey) and I physically might be in extreme discomfort or pain, rendering the idea of being in an unpredictable, \"rustic\" environment with shared (and probably less-than-sanitary) facilities entirely unappealing?\n\nShe made a face and didn't say anything else about it, but a couple weeks later at Christmas, hubby and I's Christmas gift was a homemade gift certificate explaining that our family's camping expenses were prepaid in full. \n\nI mentioned to hubby that I was SUPER APPRECIATIVE of this gesture, but that I simultaneously feel that she's manipulating me into a position of not being able to say \"no\" to coming on the camping trip, which I dislike. He was irritated with me for seeing ulterior motives in his mom's generosity.\n\nTL;DR - I tell MIL we *might* not be coming on a traditional yearly camping trip due to my having given birth just weeks prior, she responds by paying for our portion of expenses...I feel she's manipulating me/us into coming, hubby feels I'm being ungrateful and petty.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems like you have valid concerns about your brother's ability to care for a dog, especially a breed like a German Shepherd, which requires time, training, and attention. Your worries about the dog's well-being and the potential risks to your grandmother are reasonable. \n\nWhile your family may feel that your brother should pursue his dream, it's important to consider the responsibilities that come with pet ownership. A dog is a long-term commitment, and if your brother is unable to provide the necessary care, it could lead to negative outcomes for both the dog and your family.\n\nYou are not necessarily the asshole for expressing your concerns, especially if they come from a place of care for both your brother and the potential dog. It might be helpful to frame your conversation around the responsibilities of dog ownership rather than simply telling him he shouldn't get the dog. This way, you can encourage him to think critically about the decision rather than dismissing his dream outright. \n\nUltimately, it's a tough situation, but your intentions seem to be in the right place.",

        "model_response": "Your reaction to your stepmother's comment seems to stem from a place of hurt and frustration regarding your mother's passing and the circumstances surrounding your father's remarriage. While it's understandable that you were upset by her remark, the way you responded\u2014by making a joke about your mother's death\u2014could be perceived as insensitive, especially in the context of a family gathering.\n\nHumor can be a coping mechanism, but it can also backfire, particularly when it involves sensitive topics like death. Your stepmother's comment was indeed inappropriate, but your response may have escalated the situation and caused further tension within the family.\n\nIn this case, it seems that your reaction might be seen as crossing a line, especially since it involved a deeply personal and painful subject. While you may not have intended to hurt anyone, the impact of your words can be significant. It might be worth considering an apology to your father and stepmother, acknowledging that your response was not the best way to handle the situation, even if you felt justified in your feelings at the time. This could help mend any rifts and foster better communication moving forward.",

        "model_response": "Your situation is quite complex, and it touches on themes of friendship, loyalty, and financial considerations. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Understanding Mandy's Feelings**: It's clear that Mandy has a deep emotional connection to the idea of traveling to the Balkans with you. By not inviting her, even with the intention of protecting her feelings, you inadvertently hurt her more. She likely feels excluded from a dream that she has shared with you for years.\n\n2. **Intentions vs. Impact**: While your intentions were to spare her feelings, the impact of your decision was significant. It\u2019s important to recognize that good intentions do not always lead to good outcomes. Mandy's reaction indicates that she feels betrayed and left out, which is understandable given the history you share.\n\n3. **Financial Considerations**: You mentioned that you were concerned about Mandy's financial situation and the potential for her to make questionable decisions to fund the trip. While your concern is valid, it might have been more supportive to discuss the trip with her openly. You could have explored options together, such as finding a more affordable way for her to join or discussing her financial situation candidly.\n\n4. **Communication**: Your boyfriend's suggestion to bring it up earlier could have allowed for a more open dialogue. If you had discussed the trip while planning, it might have given Mandy a chance to express her feelings and perhaps even explore ways to make it work financially.\n\n5. **Future Opportunities**: While you mentioned the possibility of going on a similar trip in the future, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that this may not be enough for Mandy right now. She may need time to process her feelings before she can consider future plans.\n\nIn conclusion, while you may not have intended to hurt Mandy, the decision not to invite her has caused significant emotional pain. It might be worth reaching out to her to express your understanding of her feelings and to see if there\u2019s a way to mend the friendship. Open communication and empathy can go a long way in resolving this situation.",

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a really tough situation, and it's understandable to feel hurt and frustrated about what happened with your education funds. From what you've described, it seems like your mom made a decision that had a significant impact on your future without fully considering your feelings or the implications of her actions. \n\nYou expressed your feelings to her, which is important in any relationship, especially with family. It's natural to want to communicate when you feel wronged or hurt, especially when it involves something as significant as your education and future. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider your mom's perspective. She may have acted out of fear or concern for your academic performance, believing that she was making a decision that was in your best interest, even if it was misguided. \n\nIn this situation, it seems like both you and your mom made mistakes. You were right to express your feelings, but it might have been more constructive to approach the conversation with an understanding of her perspective as well. \n\nSo, in terms of whether you're the \"asshole\" (AITA) or if everyone shares some blame (ESH), it seems like a mix. You were justified in feeling hurt and expressing that, but the way it was communicated could have been more empathetic. Your mom also made a significant error in judgment regarding your education funds. \n\nUltimately, it's a complex situation, and it might be helpful to continue the conversation with your mom, focusing on understanding each other's perspectives and finding a way to move forward together.",

My mom makes him breakfast almost every morning and does his laundry because he is too glued to his video games. He works a part time job but other than that, its just video games. My parents have been trying to encourage him to go back to school, whether his old uni or community college, or apply to a different job (he hates his customer job.) and he just shuts down and tells them \"yeah yeah now get out of my room.\" and slams the door and goes back to video games.

It sounds like you've been trying to support your brother and encourage him to take responsibility for his life, which can be incredibly challenging when he seems resistant to change. \n\nIn the heat of the moment, it's easy to say things that might come off as harsh, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed by the situation. While your feelings are valid, the way you expressed them may have added to the tension rather than helping your brother see your perspective. \n\nIt might be helpful to have a calmer conversation with him when emotions aren't running high. You could express your concerns again, but this time focus on how his behavior affects you and the family, rather than making it about his shortcomings. Encouraging him to seek help and take steps toward independence is important, but it may be more effective if approached with empathy and understanding rather than frustration.\n\nUltimately, it's a tough situation, and you're not alone in feeling frustrated.

He does this continuously throughout the show, at least once ever 5 minutes, and often will interrupt intense moments with his predictions which I find ruins the experience for me. Like, in very suspenseful scenes where a character is obviously in danger, he will say something along the lines of \u201che\u2019s going to die\u201d. I also will add that his predictions are wrong more often than not.\n\nI have talked to him many times and told him that it annoys me and ruins the mood but his behaviour has not changed. I\u2019ve also tried my best to compromise and suggest that we discuss after we finish an episode what we think might happen next or he does it less often and not during important scenes but have not had any success with that. \n\nThis has made me not want to watch any shows or movies with him so I now mainly watch Netflix alone. One show we do still watch together though is Stranger Things. When season 3 came out and I realised that I wasn\u2019t even excited to watch it because I knew he would ruin it for me, I decided to take a stand. \n\nBasically, I binge watched most of the episodes in blissful silence before he came over and we started watching it together. Every time he would make a prediction, if it was right, I would agree with him and, if he was wrong, I would give my own \u201cprediction\u201d based on what actually happens. It took him a while to catch on but as the show progressed I got more and more specific with my \u201cpredictions\u201d until it became obvious that I had already seen it. \n\nWhen he realised what was going on, he was really angry at me for giving him spoilers. I tried explaining to him that while his predictions don\u2019t actually give the plot away, they still spoil the show for me and I wanted him to know how it felt. He then complained that I was being petty and taking revenge for something that isn\u2019t even that bad. However, I believe I was justified as I had tried talking to him and offering compromises but he was unwilling to see things from my perspective or make any effort to change his behaviour. \n\nI guess I\u2019m wondering if what I did was over the top or if I\u2019m being irrational for even finding his habit as annoying as I do. Is making constant predictions a normal thing to do while watching shows? Some insight would be greatly appreciated.",
        "model_response": "Your situation is understandable, and it's clear that you've been frustrated by your boyfriend's behavior while watching shows together. Communication is key in any relationship, and it seems like you've made several attempts to express your feelings and find a compromise. \n\nWhile his habit of making predictions might seem harmless to him, it can be disruptive to the viewing experience, especially if it happens frequently and during intense moments. Your decision to binge-watch the show and then respond to his predictions with spoilers was a way to illustrate how his behavior affects you, but it also crossed a line into giving him spoilers, which can be seen as unfair.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to find a balance between expressing your feelings and respecting each other's viewing habits. Instead of taking the approach you did, it might have been more effective to have a calm conversation about how his predictions make you feel and to set clear boundaries for watching shows together. \n\nUltimately, while your feelings are valid, the method you chose to address the issue may not have been the best approach. It could be helpful to have another conversation with him, acknowledging that you understand his perspective but also expressing how important it is for you to enjoy the experience without interruptions. Finding a solution together that respects both of your preferences could strengthen your relationship.",

However, purposely sabotaging a coworker, even if you feel disrespected, is generally considered unprofessional and can create a toxic work environment. \n\nWhile it's understandable to feel frustrated when someone bypasses your role, retaliating in a way that negatively impacts your coworker\u2019s work and reputation is not the best approach. It could lead to further conflict and damage relationships within your team. \n\nIn a professional setting, it's usually more effective to communicate openly about your feelings and the importance of following the established processes. Instead of seeking revenge, consider discussing the situation with your coworker or bringing it up with your managers to clarify roles and expectations. This way, you can foster a more collaborative and respectful workplace. \n\nSo, in summary, while your feelings are valid, your actions could be seen as wrong in the context of workplace ethics and professionalism.",

For work, he wears a button up shirt, jeans or Dockers, multi-colored sneakers and a belt with a large buckle of an animal. On weekends, he wears a t-shirt with some sort of comic/cartoon logo/character, a comic book character logo hat, jeans, multi-colored sneakers, a belt with a large buckle of a comic book character and his comic book character logo baseball hat. The only people who ever compliment his clothes are teens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe claims that other people at his work dress the same way, and they do ... but they don't wear huge belt buckles with animals on them and their shoes are more muted - all black sneakers, for example.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've tried all the hints - buying him nice clothes, shoes ... they all get returned or stuffed in the closet. I confronted him and said I would find him much more attractive if he dressed more his age, he laughed me off and said that when we met, he dressed the same so why should he change now, his is who he is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut when we met, we were 28. And he did NOT wear these clothes as often as he does now because even then he knew that girls aren't exactly attracted to a guy wearing comic book character shirts. I think it's a combo of the popularity of the Marvel movies and now him having a wife that has basically given him license to feel like he can wear whatever the fuck he wants. It's really the combination of it all together - clown shoes, comic book shirt, comic book belt buckle and hat that are just so stupid looking, I can't stand it. HE'S GONNA BE 40 FFS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've told him this and he just shrugs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA month ago, we went to a party and all the guys were dressed so nicely and simply ... and then there's my husband in his Deadpool hat, shorts, clown shoes, Batman belt and Green Lantern hat. Even his mates were poking fun at his outfit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I took a bunch of his shirts, packed them away and hid them. He has SO many shirts (he's a shopper and sucks at doing the laundry, but that's a separate issue) that I knew he wouldn't notice for awhile. He started dressing nicer - he assumed his comic book shirts were dirty so he started wearing plain t-shirts and polos that he usually never touches. He looked so nice and handsome, like how he did when we started dating. I love it. Shower him with affection because he looks SO MUCH BETTER. Tell him how nice he looks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, a month later, he found the box of shirts. He's now pissed at me. I told him it was for his own good, but he's not having any of it. He left for work mad at me but I really don't think I did anything wrong. It's not like I threw them away or donated them or something. Tonight will be interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway ... am I the asshole?\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - husband likes his comic book character shirts, i hate them. Talking about it didn't work. Giving him nicer clothes didn't work. I hid his shirts, he dressed better for awhile but then found out and is pissed.",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you have good intentions behind your actions, wanting your husband to dress in a way that you find more attractive and appropriate for his age. However, hiding his shirts without his consent crosses a boundary in your relationship. \n\nWhile you may feel justified in your actions because you believe it was for his own good, it\u2019s important to recognize that your husband has a right to express himself through his clothing choices, even if you don\u2019t agree with them. Communication is key in any relationship, and it appears that you\u2019ve already tried to express your feelings about his style. Instead of hiding his clothes, a more constructive approach might have been to have an open and honest conversation about how his clothing choices make you feel, while also being receptive to his perspective.\n\nUltimately, while your intentions may have been positive, the method you chose to address the issue was not respectful of his autonomy. Therefore, it could be argued that you are, in fact, the \"asshole\" in this situation for taking such a unilateral action without his knowledge or agreement. It would be beneficial to apologize for your approach and work together to find a compromise that respects both of your preferences.",

Completely straight up ignores me and just acts like I don't exist. He won't even look at me if I walk by. My step mom on the other hand talks to me sometimes, but only to tell me how sad she is that I'm not like the other girls at church.\n\nIt's been hard dealing with this. I'm not comfortable in my own home. I can't even go downstairs to eat right now and I'm starving. They won't let my little brother hang out with me. They made family holiday plans for the 4th and didn't bother inviting me.\n\nMy bf and his mom think that I should apologize for ever hiding the birth control in the first place, but mostly to \"make peace\" but I don't want to. I feel like their punishment is too harsh and it's hurting me. I'm completely alone. I have over $1000 in bills to pay and I can't even attend college this year because I don't have the money and they don't help with anything.\n\nThey're saying I'm in the wrong for not apologizing and fixing it myself.

        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it sounds like you're in a very difficult position. Your feelings of isolation and discomfort in your own home are completely valid. It's important to recognize that you have the right to make choices about your own body and health, including the use of birth control, regardless of your parents' beliefs.\n\nYour dad's reaction seems extreme, especially considering that you are an adult capable of making your own decisions. While your boyfriend and his mom may suggest that you apologize to ease tensions, it's also important to consider whether that apology would be sincere or simply a way to placate your parents. \n\nUltimately, you are not in the wrong for wanting to maintain your autonomy and for feeling hurt by their treatment of you. It might be worth considering how you want to approach this situation moving forward. If you feel comfortable, you could try to have an open conversation with your dad about your feelings and the importance of your independence. However, if you believe that they are unlikely to understand your perspective, it may be best to focus on your own well-being and seek support from friends or other family members who respect your choices.\n\nIn summary, you are not the one at fault here. Your parents' reaction seems disproportionate, and it's understandable that you would feel conflicted about apologizing when you don't believe you did anything wrong.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you are trying to navigate a complex social dynamic involving your fianc\u00e9's ex-girlfriend and your upcoming wedding. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Respecting Boundaries**: It\u2019s clear that both you and your fianc\u00e9 feel strongly about the ex-girlfriend's presence at the wedding, especially given the circumstances of her recent breakup with Rob. If Rob has expressed that he does not want her there, it\u2019s reasonable for you to want to support him in that decision.\n\n2. **Communication**: Sending a message to the ex-girlfriend could be seen as taking a proactive approach to prevent potential drama at your wedding. However, it\u2019s important to consider how this might be received. She may feel hurt or defensive, which could escalate tensions rather than alleviate them.\n\n3. **Direct Approach**: Since Rob has already indicated that he wants her to know she shouldn\u2019t come, it might be more effective for him to communicate this directly. This way, it doesn\u2019t put you in the middle of a potentially uncomfortable situation.\n\n4. **Your Wedding Day**: Ultimately, your wedding day should be a celebration without unnecessary stress. If you believe that her presence would create tension, it\u2019s understandable to want to address it.\n\n5. **Potential Backlash**: Consider the possibility of backlash from her or even from Rob if he feels that you overstepped by contacting her directly. It\u2019s important to maintain a good relationship with all parties involved.\n\nIn conclusion, while your intentions are good and you want to protect your wedding day, it might be best to encourage Rob to handle the situation directly with his ex-girlfriend. This way, you can avoid any potential fallout and keep the focus on your upcoming celebration.",

I am posting this because my relationship with my brother is in jeopardy and I need to know if I am being an asshole/fair.\n\nMy brother is a recovering alcoholic and has been sober for 3 years. He had a harder life than I did, we both went to college, but he dropped out after one semester and everything went downhill from there. He started drinking, lived paycheck to paycheck, etc. \n\nHe has been cleaning himself up and met a girl (whom I am not too crazy about, she's the type to get lots of tattoos and whatnot, not a great influence). They ended up marrying last year. \n\nEven though my brother seems happy and better, they are still poor and live in a cramped apartment with a roommate, barely getting by. Last week we were all over my parents house and my brother told everyone that they have an announcement; his wife is pregnant.\n\nEveryone said the usual \"congratulations,\" I stayed silent and after the surprise wore down, I took my brother to the next room over and said \"you can't be serious? You're having a child when you keep having money problems?\"\n\nHe got mad at me and told me his situation was none of my business. He shouted at me which caused everyone in the next room to overhear. I got mad and told him \"it's unfair to the child to have to grow up in such shitty conditions because you're irresponsible.\"\n\nWe argued and everyone tried to intervene to get us to stop. My brother said to me that I am just jealous of him because I can't find a girl who likes me, I told him at least I am not poor. It was an ugly exchange of words unfortunately. \n\nMy brother and his wife decided to leave and I shouted out to them \"enjoy the bus ride home!\" while he told me to go f myself, just to show how bad the argument got.\n\nMe, my parents and sister had a talk. My sister agreed that they shouldn't have a baby, my parents said it's not our place to decide that.",
        "model_response": "Your situation with your brother is quite complex, and it sounds like emotions are running high on both sides. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Concern vs. Judgment**: It's understandable to be concerned about your brother's ability to provide for a child, especially given his financial situation and past struggles with alcoholism. However, the way you expressed your concerns may have come off as judgmental rather than supportive. It's important to approach sensitive topics like this with empathy.\n\n2. **Timing and Setting**: Bringing up your concerns immediately after the announcement, in a private but heated manner, may not have been the best approach. It could have been more constructive to wait for a calmer moment to discuss your worries.\n\n3. **Respecting Autonomy**: Your brother and his wife are adults and have the right to make their own decisions about starting a family, even if you disagree with those choices. While you may have valid concerns, ultimately, it's their life and their responsibility.\n\n4. **Communication Style**: The way you communicated your feelings\u2014especially the comment about the \"shitty conditions\"\u2014could be perceived as harsh and unsupportive. This may have escalated the argument and hurt your brother more than it helped.\n\n5. **Family Dynamics**: Family discussions about sensitive topics can be tricky. Your parents' stance of not wanting to interfere is valid, as they may want to maintain peace within the family. Your sister's agreement with you might indicate that there are shared concerns, but it\u2019s essential to approach these discussions with care to avoid further conflict.\n\n6. **Reflection**: Consider reflecting on your motivations for speaking out. Were you genuinely concerned for the child's well-being, or were there other feelings at play, such as frustration with your brother's choices or your own situation?\n\nIn conclusion, while your concerns may be valid, the way you expressed them could be seen as overstepping. It might be beneficial to reach out to your brother to apologize for how the conversation went and express that your intentions were rooted in concern, not judgment. This could help mend your relationship and open the door for more constructive conversations in the future.",

I am posting this because my relationship with my brother is in jeopardy and I need to know if I am being an asshole/fair.\n\nMy brother is a recovering alcoholic and has been sober for 3 years. He had a harder life than I did, we both went to college, but he dropped out after one semester and everything went downhill from there. He started drinking, lived paycheck to paycheck, etc. \n\nHe has been cleaning himself up and met a girl (whom I am not too crazy about, she's the type to get lots of tattoos and whatnot, not a great influence). They ended up marrying last year. \n\nEven though my brother seems happy and better, they are still poor and live in a cramped apartment with a roommate, barely getting by. Last week we were all over my parents house and my brother told everyone that they have an announcement; his wife is pregnant.\n\nEveryone said the usual \"congratulations,\" I stayed silent and after the surprise wore down, I took my brother to the next room over and said \"you can't be serious? You're having a child when you keep having money problems?\"\n\nHe got mad at me and told me his situation was none of my business. He shouted at me which caused everyone in the next room to overhear. I got mad and told him \"it's unfair to the child to have to grow up in such shitty conditions because you're irresponsible.\"\n\nWe argued and everyone tried to intervene to get us to stop. My brother said to me that I am just jealous of him because I can't find a girl who likes me, I told him at least I am not poor. It was an ugly exchange of words unfortunately. \n\nMy brother and his wife decided to leave and I shouted out to them \"enjoy the bus ride home!\" while he told me to go f myself, just to show how bad the argument got.\n\nMe, my parents and sister had a talk. My sister agreed that they shouldn't have a baby, my parents said it's not our place to decide that.",

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a very challenging situation, and it's understandable to feel frustrated and overwhelmed. Caring for an aging parent, especially one with serious health issues, is a significant responsibility, and it's natural to hope that your siblings would step up to help, especially given their financial stability.\n\nFrom what you've described, it seems reasonable to expect some level of support from your siblings, particularly those who live nearby and have the means to assist. While you acknowledge that no one is obligated to help, it\u2019s also fair to want clarity about their intentions and willingness to contribute, especially when it comes to your mother's care and well-being.\n\nYour feelings about wanting them to sacrifice some luxuries to help out are valid, especially since you have been carrying the burden for so long. It's important to communicate your needs and expectations clearly with them, as it may help to alleviate some of the stress you're experiencing. \n\nUltimately, you are not wrong for wanting support from your siblings during this difficult time. It's a tough situation, and seeking help is a natural response when facing such significant responsibilities. You deserve support, and it's okay to express that to your family.",

She is 25 and I am 41. She looks a lot younger than she is and sometimes the supervisor gets on her for things that aren't really a huge issue, but I think she is talking town to her because she looks like she is a teenager. I told her that she should dress older, which she did and the boss started talking down to her less. Anyways, yesterday she was supposed to print out a memo she had written and she accidentally misgendered a client in the memo (who is trans). She caught this typo shortly after printing out the memo and putting it in everyone's box. She panicked, ran down to the mailroom and frantically pulled all the memos and then reprinted the memos and replaced them in everyone's box. Instead of just telling the boss, she did all this because this lady is exceptionally hard on her and she was afraid she might lose her job for this small mistake. The only person who had taken the original memo out of the box was another young girl and she ran to this girls cubicle, asked her for the memo and replaced it with a new one and asked her not to tell the boss, which this girl promised not to. At lunch she went to staples and bought paper to replace the paper from the memo so the boss wouldn't catch all the missing paper. I thought it was kind of dishonest, so I told the boss what happened. The boss reprimanded her in the meeting in front of everyone and this girl started crying and left the office for the day. The other girl who know the problem came up to me after the meeting and told me I was an asshole for reporting her to the boss, and said the typo was not a big deal and she said I should have known the boss would have an unreasonable response and that this girl was just trying to save herself from this issue. Am I the asshole?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that your intentions were to uphold honesty and accountability in the workplace, but the consequences of your actions had a significant emotional impact on your coworker. Reporting her to the boss for a mistake that she was already trying to rectify may have been perceived as harsh, especially since she was acting out of fear of losing her job.\n\nWhile it's important to maintain integrity in the workplace, it's also crucial to consider the context and the potential repercussions of reporting someone for a minor mistake, especially when they were already taking steps to correct it. Your coworker was clearly anxious about the situation, and your decision to report her may have exacerbated her distress.\n\nThe other coworker's reaction suggests that they felt your actions were excessive given the circumstances. It might be worth reflecting on whether there could have been a more supportive approach, such as discussing the situation with your coworker first or advising her to speak to the boss herself.\n\nUltimately, whether you are the \"asshole\" in this situation depends on your perspective on accountability versus compassion. Many might view your actions as overly harsh, especially considering the emotional toll it took on your coworker.",

        "model_response": "Your intention to help your friend is understandable, but the way you're approaching the situation raises some ethical concerns. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Objectification**: The idea of taking your friend to another country specifically to \"get laid\" can come off as objectifying women. It reduces the experience of intimacy and connection to a transactional encounter, which many people find problematic.\n\n2. **Consent and Respect**: It's important to remember that relationships and encounters should be based on mutual consent and respect. Treating women as a means to an end for your friend's personal goals can be seen as disrespectful.\n\n3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Traveling to another country with the intention of pursuing romantic or sexual encounters can also be viewed as exploitative, especially if it plays into stereotypes about women in those cultures.\n\n4. **Friendship Dynamics**: While you may have good intentions, your friend's first sexual experience is a significant moment in his life. It might be more beneficial to support him in finding a meaningful connection rather than focusing solely on the act itself.\n\n5. **Communication**: It might be worth having an open conversation with your friend about what he truly wants and how he feels about your proposal. His feelings and comfort should be prioritized.\n\nIn summary, while your desire to help your friend is commendable, the approach may not be the most respectful or appropriate. It could be more beneficial to encourage him to build genuine connections rather than focusing on the idea of losing his virginity in a specific way.",

        "model_response": "Your situation raises an important question about parenting and teaching responsibility. It seems like your intention is to instill a strong work ethic and a sense of accountability in your son, which is commendable. However, the way you communicated your decision may have come off as harsh, especially if he feels that you are withdrawing support without a clear understanding of why.\n\nIt's understandable to want your son to appreciate the value of money and hard work, but it's also important to consider his feelings and the potential impact of your decision on his passion for hockey and other activities. Open communication about your expectations and the reasons behind your decision could help bridge the gap between you and your son.\n\nIn this case, while your intentions may not be wrong, the approach could be perceived as lacking empathy. It might be beneficial to have a conversation with your son about the importance of both hard work and support from family, rather than making it an ultimatum. This way, you can encourage him to take responsibility while still showing that you care about his interests.\n\nUltimately, whether you are the \"asshole\" or not depends on the perspective of those involved. Some may agree with your stance on teaching responsibility, while others may feel that your approach could be softened. It\u2019s worth considering a middle ground that allows for both lessons in responsibility and continued support for his interests.",

After speaking with her about it in the back, she came out laughing which angered my table even more. They were so pissed that they didn\u2019t want to finish their food and that prompted them to demand to speak to the GM. She continued to laugh while all of this was happening.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems like you're feeling justified in your reaction to your coworker's behavior, especially since it directly impacted your earnings and the experience of your table. It's understandable to feel upset when you believe you've worked hard to provide good service, only to have a coworker's actions undermine that effort.\n\nHowever, while your feelings are valid, the decision to not talk to her until she apologizes could be seen as a form of passive aggression. It might create a tense work environment and could affect team dynamics. Communication is key in any workplace, and addressing the issue directly with her might lead to a better understanding and resolution.\n\nInstead of waiting for an apology, consider having a calm conversation with her about how her actions affected you and the situation with the table. This approach could help clear the air and potentially lead to an apology or at least an acknowledgment of the impact of her behavior.\n\nIn summary, while you are not wrong to feel upset, the choice to not communicate could be seen as counterproductive. Open dialogue might be a more constructive way to handle the situation.",

While your reaction may have been a bit intense, it seems like you were at your breaking point after multiple interruptions. It might be helpful to communicate your needs to your mom more clearly, perhaps setting specific times for calls when you're not trying to rest. Overall, you're not a jerk for wanting to take care of yourself, but finding a way to express that without yelling could improve your relationship with your mom.",

But I was sort of excited to go on a hike yesterday. We are in San Diego for the fourth of July and my cousin said it would be really fun if me and my friends went on a hike while she (cousin) had to work. We went to a place called Cowles mountain which I guess is about 45 minutes away from the hotel downtown. \n\nWhen we got there it was pretty crowded and we saw a group of guys coming down who were just blasting rap music. I was like wow that would be an awesome way to not get bored on the hike so I went back to my car and got my blue tooth speaker from my pack and hit my favorite spotify list. \n\nMost people didn't seem to mind but I did notice that we started to get occasional dirty looks. But finally one person stopped me and told me it was incredibly rude to play music outloud and that I should be using headphones. I told her that I was playing music for our group. And she basically that it's still very rude and against the rules but she kept walking. \n\nWe decided we just weren't going to make it to the top so we stopped at a kind of flat spot and sat down for a while and this is when things actually got kind of scary. This guy and his girlfriend came up to us and said again that I should be using headphones. I told her that we were in a group. She said that it didn't matter most people were trying to enjoy quiet nature. I told her that that its public land. She said \"if you weren't such an ignorant fat bitch you would have noticed the sign at the bottom that said no speakers.\" I basically shut down because I'm not good at confrontation but my friend asked her if she wanted to repeat herself. So the girlfriend called her a fat bitch as well and her boyfriend had to drag her away she was so upset. I didn't want any more hassle so I turned off the speaker and they walked away but the girl was just glaring at us and I was actually scared that they would slash my tires or something at the bottom. \n\nI have been reliving the confrontation over and over again and didn't sleep last night. I admit to being fully ignorant because I don't do a lot of outdoor stuff but was that really a big deal? I mean at least one other group we saw was doing it so I can't be that out of touch? All I was trying to do was make it a little more enjoyable and really meant no offense. \n\nI posted this on another sub and was referenced here so i'm a little scared just because of the title but please be honest with me. \n\nWas I doing something wrong?\n\nedit in advance: using a throwaway",
        "model_response": "Based on the context you've provided, it seems that playing music on a Bluetooth speaker in a public hiking area, especially when there are signs indicating that it's not allowed, can be considered disrespectful to others who are trying to enjoy the natural surroundings in peace. While you may have intended to enhance your experience and that of your friends, the reactions from other hikers suggest that many people value the tranquility of nature and prefer to enjoy it without added noise.\n\nThe confrontation you experienced, while unfortunate, highlights that not everyone shares the same perspective on what is acceptable in shared spaces. It's important to consider the environment and the preferences of others when engaging in activities that could impact their experience.\n\nIn summary, while your intention was not malicious, playing music aloud in a nature setting where it is prohibited can be seen as inconsiderate. It might be a good idea to use headphones in such situations in the future to ensure that everyone can enjoy the environment as they wish.",

You typically do not allow her outside at night, and it seems like this was an isolated incident. Your concern about your neighbors setting a trap without first discussing the issue with you is also reasonable, especially since your cat is not the one causing the damage.\n\nHowever, your neighbors may have felt justified in their actions if they believed a cat was damaging their property. They might not have known that your cat was not the culprit, and their frustration could have led them to take action without considering the potential consequences for your pet.\n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" it seems that neither party acted with malicious intent. You didn't mean to let your cat out, and your neighbors were trying to protect their property. It might be helpful to have a conversation with them to clarify the situation and express your feelings about how they handled it.

We planned to leave on Friday morning. This is why I canceled the trip:\n\nMy husband's car is 15 years old and has 265k miles on it. (He's said repeatedly that he wants to hit 300k.) The check engine and brake lights have been on for several months. A few weeks ago, the car overheated and died while I was driving it, and he discovered a crack in the radiator that he sealed with some kind of epoxy. (He previously said that it probably just needed fluid.) Then the brakes started grinding, and after a few days he agreed to take it into the shop. In the interim, the brakes failed to catch correctly while I was driving our daughter home from daycare, and I narrowly avoided an accident. He had the brakes replaced (although previously he'd said, as with the radiator, that they only needed fluid).\n\nNow the check engine light is flashing, and the car is shaking at speeds above 50mph. Every Google search result says this indicates a misfire that could result in catastrophic engine damage (something about the catalytic converter). My husband says he's narrowed it down to a fuel injector problem, and he wants to repair it himself today and go on the road trip tomorrow as planned. I told him that I didn't trust the car and didn't want our daughter in it, and I texted our friends last night and said we couldn't go.\n\nNow my husband is angry--he thinks I'm being anxious for no reason because he knows cars better than I do and has done \"hundreds of hours of research\" into car repair. (He is not a mechanic, but he is very handy, and he's made successful car repairs in the past.) Our friends are disappointed because they planned a weekend of activities that they won't be able to reschedule for several months. No one seems to agree with me that driving would have been unsafe. Am I the asshole?",
        "model_response": "Based on the information you've provided, it seems that you made a responsible decision to prioritize the safety of your daughter and yourself by canceling the trip. Given the condition of your husband's car, including the check engine light, brake issues, and the fact that it has a high mileage, your concerns about the vehicle's reliability and safety are valid. \n\nWhile your husband may have confidence in his ability to repair the car, the potential risks associated with driving a vehicle that is experiencing multiple issues\u2014especially with a child in the car\u2014are significant. Your decision to cancel the trip reflects a cautious and protective approach, which is important when it comes to family safety.\n\nIn this situation, it doesn't seem like you are the \"asshole.\" You acted in the best interest of your family, and it's understandable that your husband may feel frustrated, but safety should always come first. It's important to communicate openly about these concerns and work together to find a solution that ensures everyone's safety in the future.",

My room is full of Pokemon, video games, and other nerdy collectables that I've spent years collecting, some of them were expensive. I don't really like the idea of kids that I mostly don't even know invading my room and touching my stuff. Sometimes I'll come home and find some of my stuff laying on my floor or rearranged on my shelves and get I'll get upset and they don't understand why. I feel like I have no privacy and I don't understand why they can't just let the kids watch a movie or play in their bedroom or outside. My siblings and my mom disagree because my collectables are toys and they don't see the harm in letting kids I don't even know go into my room as long as they are supervised and promise not to let them take anything and clean everything up. Most of my stuff are plushes or plastic so they aren't easily breakable. I also have a senior cat who is very skittish and especially scared of children and men with deep voices. They promised me they would start only letting them in my room if I was home and if I said it's ok, but I know that they still go into my room anyway while I'm gone sometimes.\n\nAm I overreacting? I get that I have a bunch of toys in my room and that the kids think my room is cool, but it makes me really upset knowing that I have no say in who comes in and out of my room during the day while I'm gone and that they could be messing with my stuff and scaring my cat. Last night, I tried asking them again if they could please keep the children out of my room and they argued that because I now have a nephew, I should get used to having kids playing with my toys because I'll have no choice once he gets older, although I have already put aside some of my things that I would let him play with when he visits. They think I'm really overreacting and don't understand why I'm so uncomfortable and upset over this.\n\nAlso, I was planning on moving out by the end of the year now that I have a better job that doesn't pay minimum wage but I'm seriously considering moving out sooner just so I can have a peace of mind. \n\nFor reference, I'm a 23 female and I'm on the autism scale.

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a tough situation, and it's completely understandable to feel upset about your personal space being invaded, especially when it comes to your belongings and your cat's comfort. Your feelings are valid, and it's important to have boundaries regarding your personal space and possessions.\n\nFrom what you've described, it seems like your family may not fully understand or respect your need for privacy and the significance of your collectibles to you. While they may see your items as toys, they hold value for you, both financially and sentimentally. It's also concerning that they are not fully acknowledging your cat's needs and how the presence of children might affect her.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Communication**: It might help to have a calm and clear conversation with your family about your feelings. Explain why your room is important to you and how it makes you feel when they allow others in without your consent. Emphasize that it's not just about the items but also about your need for privacy.\n\n2. **Setting Boundaries**: You have every right to set boundaries regarding your personal space. If you feel strongly about keeping your room off-limits to others, communicate that clearly. You might also consider putting a lock on your door if that's an option, to help enforce your boundaries.\n\n3. **Understanding Their Perspective**: While it's important for your family to understand your perspective, it might also help to try to understand theirs. They may see it as harmless fun for the kids, but that doesn't mean your feelings are any less valid.\n\n4. **Moving Out**: If you feel that your living situation is causing you significant distress and you have the means to move out sooner, that could be a good option for your peace of mind. Having your own space can help you feel more in control and comfortable.\n\n5. **Support**: Since you mentioned being on the autism scale, it might be helpful to seek support from friends, a therapist, or a support group who can understand your perspective and help you navigate these family dynamics.\n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance between your family's desires and your need for privacy and comfort. You deserve to feel safe and respected in your own space.",

We're attempting to make new friends, but it can be slow going when you don't have any social networks. Last night my wife got home around 2 hours later than she normally does, but I figured she was probably out doing some chore. When she got home she started telling me about a friend she made. \"Good for her\", I initially thought, until I asked for more details. Apparently she started talking to another passenger in an Uber (let's call him Tony\"). They were stuck in traffic and had an sizable chunk of time to get to know each other. The uber driver goes to drop Tony off at his place, at which point he invites my up to his place to \"continue the conversation\". To my horror, my wife accepted and spent the last hour and a half at his place.  \n\n\nShe can tell I was annoyed as she recounted this and asked what was wrong. I was upset that she went into a strange mans house who was most likely trying to hit on her. She said I was being ridiculous and that she was just making a new friend. I brought up that if he did try something no one would know where she was at.

        "model_response": "Your feelings of concern are understandable given the context of the situation. It's natural to feel uneasy when a partner engages in behavior that could be perceived as risky or inappropriate, especially when it involves spending time alone with a stranger in a private setting. \n\nYour wife may see this as an innocent opportunity to make a new friend, but your perspective highlights valid concerns about safety and boundaries in a relationship. Communication is key here. It might be helpful to express your feelings to her in a calm and constructive manner, focusing on your concerns for her safety rather than accusing her of wrongdoing. \n\nUltimately, it's important for both of you to discuss your boundaries and expectations in your relationship, especially as you navigate new social situations in a new city. Finding a balance between trust and concern is crucial for maintaining a healthy relationship.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, your reaction to the person texting during the movie can be seen from different perspectives. \n\nOn one hand, you have a valid point about wanting to enjoy the movie without distractions. Many people find texting during a film to be inconsiderate, as it can disrupt the experience for others. Politely asking someone to put their phone away is reasonable, especially if it\u2019s affecting your enjoyment.\n\nOn the other hand, the way you escalated the situation by using aggressive language could be perceived as confrontational. While it\u2019s understandable to feel frustrated, responding with aggression may not have been the best approach. It could have led to unnecessary conflict, and the other person might have felt defensive or disrespected.\n\nIn hindsight, it might have been more effective to either calmly ask the person to stop texting again or to seek assistance from a staff member if the distraction continued. \n\nOverall, while your initial request was not wrong, the manner in which you handled the follow-up could be seen as excessive. So, while you\u2019re not an asshole for wanting to enjoy the movie, the way you confronted the person might not have been the most constructive approach.",

I had never met my cousin before in my life, to the point of just having downright no clue who she was when she walked into the house until I went outside and saw my great aunt. After that, we all get sat down, introduce the dogs, etc. I had been playing video games but came out to be polite and greet them and see what my dog was freaking out over.\n\nThis is where the issue arises.\n\nMy cousin then says she wants a Starbucks and asks where it is. I start describing where our local Safeway is, which has the Starbucks. I also live in a VERY small town. Mid-description she cuts me off and says, \"no, you're not going to tell me where it is. You're going to take me and get it for me.\" To which I just stare at her in disbelief. I've never met this women before and she comes into MY house and demands that I drive and buy her Starbucks with the little money I have within 5 minutes of meeting me. After I stared at her I just left.\n\nFast forward about 15 min and my grandmother comes into my room, asking again that I take her to Starbucks so she'll shut up since she obviously doesn't like her either. I said no because she was extremely rude and demanding, and that I would've had no problem taking her if she would've just asked politely (and didn't demand that I pay for it.) My grandma then says that I'm being just as rude and leaves. \n\nI told my mom and she had the same reaction that I did but later said I should've taken her when my grandma asked, despite my cousin being extremely busy. Am I the asshole for not taking my cousin to Starbucks when my grandma asked?\n\nAlso, my cousin can drive. She drove right past Safeway coming into town.\n\nP.S:I'm sorry for the trash formatting, I'm on mobile.",

You were not being rude for standing your ground against someone who was disrespectful to you.\n\nIn this case, it doesn't seem like you are the asshole for not taking your cousin to Starbucks.

I had never met my cousin before in my life, to the point of just having downright no clue who she was when she walked into the house until I went outside and saw my great aunt. After that, we all get sat down, introduce the dogs, etc. I had been playing video games but came out to be polite and greet them and see what my dog was freaking out over.\n\nThis is where the issue arises.\n\nMy cousin then says she wants a Starbucks and asks where it is. I start describing where our local Safeway is, which has the Starbucks. I also live in a VERY small town. Mid-description she cuts me off and says, \"no, you're not going to tell me where it is. You're going to take me and get it for me.\" To which I just stare at her in disbelief. I've never met this women before and she comes into MY house and demands that I drive and buy her Starbucks with the little money I have within 5 minutes of meeting me. After I stared at her I just left.\n\nFast forward about 15 min and my grandmother comes into my room, asking again that I take her to Starbucks so she'll shut up since she obviously doesn't like her either. I said no because she was extremely rude and demanding, and that I would've had no problem taking her if she would've just asked politely (and didn't demand that I pay for it.) My grandma then says that I'm being just as rude and leaves. \n\nI told my mom and she had the same reaction that I did but later said I should've taken her when my grandma asked, despite my cousin being extremely busy. Am I the asshole for not taking my cousin to Starbucks when my grandma asked?\n\nAlso, my cousin can drive. She drove right past Safeway coming into town.\n\nP.S:I'm sorry for the trash formatting, I'm on mobile.",

Since then I apologised saying that I am sorry for giving her constructive criticism in front of my mom but it didnt calm her much and she still refuses to make anything food-related at home for me.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that your intentions were to help your girlfriend improve her cooking, but the way you approached it may have come across as critical rather than supportive. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Timing and Setting**: Bringing up cooking tips in front of your mother may have made your girlfriend feel judged or embarrassed. Even if she seemed fine at the moment, it\u2019s possible that she felt undermined when you suggested that someone else could give her advice.\n\n2. **Constructive Criticism**: While constructive criticism can be helpful, it\u2019s important to ensure that it\u2019s delivered in a way that feels supportive rather than critical. It might be beneficial to ask her if she would like feedback before offering it, or to frame your suggestions in a more collaborative way.\n\n3. **Communication**: It sounds like there may have been a lack of communication about expectations and feelings regarding cooking. It might be helpful to have an open conversation about how both of you feel about cooking and any frustrations that have arisen.\n\n4. **Emotional Response**: Your girlfriend's reaction suggests that she may have felt hurt or belittled, even if that wasn\u2019t your intention. It\u2019s important to acknowledge her feelings and understand that cooking can be a personal and sensitive topic for many people.\n\nIn conclusion, while you may not have intended to hurt her feelings, it seems that your approach may have inadvertently caused her to feel criticized. It might be worth having a heartfelt conversation to clear the air and find a way to support each other in the kitchen moving forward. So, while you may not be the \"asshole\" in this situation, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s room for improvement in how you communicate about cooking.",

        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it seems that you are not the asshole (NTA) for not wanting to attend your friend's destination wedding in Moscow. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Personal Boundaries**: You have valid reasons for not wanting to go, including your fear of flying and the fact that you have never left the country. It's important to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being.\n\n2. **Destination Wedding Expectations**: As you mentioned, destination weddings often come with the understanding that not everyone will be able to attend. Your friend chose a location that is not only far away but also has specific concerns regarding safety and acceptance for certain groups, which adds to the complexity.\n\n3. **Support vs. Attendance**: You expressed your support by offering to send a gift and encouraging your friend to take pictures. Supporting someone doesn't always mean physically being there, especially when there are significant barriers.\n\n4. **Friendship Dynamics**: It sounds like your friend is feeling disappointed, which is understandable, but that doesn't mean you are in the wrong. It's important for friends to respect each other's boundaries and limitations.\n\n5. **Family Pressure**: While your family may feel that you should overcome your fears for the sake of friendship, ultimately, the decision is yours to make. It's essential to listen to your own feelings and comfort levels.\n\nIn conclusion, you are not an asshole for prioritizing your own well-being and making a decision that feels right for you. It's important to communicate openly with your friend about your feelings and the reasons behind your decision.",

I let the roommates know I was saving it. \n\nIn the AM, I went to work. When I got back at 6pm, there was only one slice left- no longer enough for dinner. Nobody else was there, so one of the roommates must have eaten them. I asked them each individually... Not mad, just curious: \" hey did you eat my pizza ?\" Never did I imagine they'd both say no. So I was like wtf, one of you is lying to my face? \n\nThing is, one roommate is always tracking macros and doesn't usually eat pizza. He easily convinced me it wasn't him, so that leaves my friend of 5 years lying to my face about something so assinine as pizza... Which makes me both disappointed and pissed, especially since my only reply to \"yes, I ate the pizza\" would have been \"oh ok cool\". \n\nGirlfriend and her friend are making fun of me for questioning my friend (\" dude you don't have to lie to me...I would not care\") while they're cracking jokes about a pizza bandit. Meanwhile I find this insulting enough to damage the friendship. Like I'd never lie to this friend about anything, much less a slice of pizza. Other friends are suggesting he just smoked weed and forgot to try to get me to drop it.\nAITA?",
        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it seems understandable that you would feel upset about your pizza being eaten, especially after you communicated that you were saving it for later. It's not just about the pizza itself, but also about the principle of honesty and respect among friends. \n\nYour reaction to feel disappointed and angry is valid, particularly since you value honesty in your friendships. It's frustrating when someone you trust doesn't own up to something that seems minor but feels significant in the context of your relationship. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the perspective of your friend. If they were indeed under the influence of something like weed, they might not have been fully aware of their actions or the implications of lying about it. \n\nIn terms of whether you're the \"asshole\" in this situation, it seems like you're not. You're expressing your feelings about a breach of trust, which is a reasonable response. However, it might be worth having a calm conversation with your friend about how you feel, rather than letting it fester. This could help clear the air and potentially strengthen your friendship in the long run. \n\nSo, in summary, you're not the asshole for being upset about the pizza and the dishonesty, but consider addressing it directly with your friend to resolve the issue.",

I'm out of college and work from home, so it's hard to meet new people. Every year around my birthday, I get really depressed now because back home I used to have huge parties to celebrate every year, but now I know like 4 people other than my boyfriend, and not super well. \n\nThis year I decided to try to have fun anyway.

I was devastated and it really made me feel like I had no friends here at all. I wound up canceling the event and cried almost every day for the next two weeks, often sobbing on my boyfriend's shirt over it. I felt totally rejected, and every time he'd just try to soothe me by telling me how much he cares and that we'd do something \"just the two of us\" instead.\n\nOn my birthday, we went out to dinner together.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that both you and your boyfriend have valid feelings, but the way the situation unfolded has led to a significant misunderstanding and hurt feelings.\n\nYour boyfriend likely intended to create a surprise that would make you happy, but he did so at the expense of your emotional well-being. By allowing you to believe that your friends had rejected you, he inadvertently caused you pain during a time when you were already feeling vulnerable. His intentions may have been good, but the execution was poor, and he should have considered how his actions would affect you emotionally.\n\nOn the other hand, your feelings of betrayal are completely understandable. You were open about your struggles with loneliness and your desire for connection, and instead of being supported through that, you were left feeling isolated and rejected. It's natural to feel hurt when someone you trust doesn't communicate openly, especially when it involves something as significant as your birthday.\n\nIn terms of who is the \"asshole,\" it seems more like a case of poor communication and misunderstanding rather than one person being outright wrong. Your boyfriend may not have realized the depth of your feelings or the impact of his actions, while you understandably feel hurt by the lack of transparency.\n\nIt might be helpful for both of you to have an open and honest conversation about your feelings. Expressing how his actions affected you and discussing the importance of communication in your relationship could help you both move forward. Ultimately, it's about understanding each other's perspectives and finding a way to support one another better in the future.",

        "model_response": "Your situation raises some interesting ethical questions. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Work Expectations**: If your employer has indicated that you can stay until the end of your shift, then you are fulfilling your work obligation by being present, even if there is no work to do. It's not uncommon for employees to have downtime, and as long as you are not being paid for work you didn't do, it may not be unethical.\n\n2. **Honesty vs. Deception**: You mentioned the idea of fibbing about doing inventory or sorting supplies. While honesty is generally the best policy, it's also important to consider the context. If the busywork is genuinely completed and there is no need for additional tasks, then it may not be necessary to fabricate reasons for staying.\n\n3. **Value of Presence**: Sometimes, being present at work can have value beyond just completing tasks. It can provide support to colleagues, maintain a professional atmosphere, or even allow for unexpected tasks that may arise.\n\n4. **Company Culture**: Consider the culture of your workplace. If it\u2019s common for employees to stay during slow periods without any issues, then your decision to stay may be perfectly acceptable. However, if the culture emphasizes productivity and efficiency, it might be worth reflecting on how your presence aligns with those values.\n\n5. **Personal Reflection**: Ultimately, whether you feel comfortable with your decision to stay is important. If you believe that you are being honest and fulfilling your role, then it may not be an issue. However, if you feel uneasy about it, it might be worth discussing your feelings with your supervisor or HR for clarity on expectations.\n\nIn summary, it doesn't seem unethical to stay at work if your employer has allowed it, but it's important to consider the context and your own feelings about the situation.",

I used to write him letters, send drawings, postcards and so on. I got letters and presents from him on my birthday and Christmas.\n\nWhen I was 9 a mean cousin told me that my dad was in prison and I was the daughter of a criminal. I ran to my mother and he confirmed it, which shattered my world (on top of being bullied by my cousins). I stopped sending letters and threw away the letters and presents I got from him.  \n\nA couple of years later I looked him up and learned that he was imprisoned for a robbery gone wrong, he and an accomplice were robbing a store, one of the patrons tried running away and they shot him in the back. They were lucky he didn't die, but still were given a hefty prison sentence. I realized that he had been in prison for longer than I had existed, so I went to my mom and she confirmed that I was conceived during a conjugal visit, which made things even worse for me.  \n\nMy mom has been in contact with him the whole time, and happily announced that he's due to be released in a couple months, and as her husband, he's going to come and live with us.  \nI told her that I don't want to have anything to do with this man, I don't want to talk to him, interact with him in anyway or even look at him, I've never even talked to him in person, nor has he ever contributed to my life in any way, so I consider him a stranger, and a criminal one at that.  \nMy mom said tough luck, I'm living in her house rent free, still a minor and I have no say in all of this. So I asked around and I found an aunt willing to take me in and pay for my sustenance, just so I don't have to be near this guy.  \n\nNow my mom is saying I'm an asshole for not giving him a chance, but I don't feel like I have to, he's a criminal, not a petty one but he tried to kill someone, and besides I was lied to for several years and only learned the truth because of someone else.\n\nAITA reddit?",
        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it seems that you have valid feelings and concerns regarding your father's release from prison and the impact it may have on your life. It's understandable that you would feel betrayed and hurt by the deception about your father's situation, especially given the severity of his crime. \n\nYour desire to distance yourself from someone you consider a stranger and a criminal is completely reasonable. You have every right to set boundaries for your own well-being, especially since you have not had a relationship with him and have only recently learned the truth about his past.\n\nYour mother's insistence that you should accept him into your life, despite your feelings, can be seen as dismissive of your emotions and autonomy. It's important for you to prioritize your mental and emotional health in this situation.\n\nIn terms of whether you are an \"asshole\" for wanting to avoid your father, it seems that you are making a choice that you believe is best for you. Seeking support from your aunt and considering alternative living arrangements demonstrates that you are taking proactive steps to protect yourself.\n\nUltimately, you are not an asshole for wanting to maintain your boundaries and for feeling the way you do about your father's past actions. It's a complex situation, and your feelings are valid.",

I sped up to it, and rested my hand on the handle. I always like to clean it with a disinfecting wipe that the store has a dispenser of, so I turned my back and walked about 5 feet from my cart to get a wipe. When I turn around, a man in his 50s sniped my cart. As a note, I am a man in my 30s. \n\nI saw it happen and said excuse me sir that was my cart. He said \u201cthere was no one here when I got here so it\u2019s mine actually\u201d and shrugged and walked away. I was extremely annoyed because there was no carts. I also anticipated a large order so I needed a cart and a basket would not be sufficient \n\nI decided to follow the man around the store. He began to put items in the cart. When he got to an aisle, he turned his back, walked about 20 feet away to look at something. I saw this as an opportunity.. he had maybe 5 items in the cart, all small food items. I took the cart and began to walk backwards. He turned around and began screaming at me. I stared at him and continued walking backwards. Then, I gently took his items out and put them on the shelf. He began to yell and said it was his cart. I responded, just as he had to me, that \u201cthere was no one here when I got here actually, it is actually mine now\u201d. \n\nHe lost it. I ignored him and began shopping. I calmly got my meats and he was berating me. A few customers noticed and the manager came out. He took both our statements and ended up getting a cart that he found in the parking lot and brought it to the man. \n\nI heard a customer say \u201c2 grown men fighting about a cart\u201d as they walked by.

        "model_response": "Yes, you were the asshole in this situation. While it\u2019s understandable to be frustrated about losing a cart, taking someone else's cart and removing their items is not an appropriate response. The man may have taken the cart when you were briefly away, but it was still not right for you to retaliate by taking it back in such a confrontational manner. Instead, you could have sought assistance from a store employee or simply waited for another cart to become available. Engaging in a confrontation and escalating the situation was unnecessary and could have led to further conflict.",

        "model_response": "Navigating family dynamics, especially when it comes to relationships and cultural differences, can be quite challenging. Here are some points to consider regarding your situation:\n\n1. **Confronting Your Sister**: If you choose to confront your sister, approach the conversation with care and empathy. Instead of telling her to end the relationship, express your concerns about her well-being and the potential challenges she might face. It's important to listen to her perspective and feelings as well.\n\n2. **Telling Your Parents**: If you decide to inform your parents, consider the potential consequences. They may react strongly, which could lead to conflict within the family. Think about whether this action would genuinely help your sister or if it might create more problems.\n\n3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Recognize that relationships can be complex and influenced by many factors beyond ethnicity and religion. Your sister may have her own reasons for being interested in this person, and it's essential to respect her autonomy.\n\n4. **Supportive Approach**: Regardless of your decision, aim to be supportive. If your sister is happy and feels safe in her relationship, it might be more beneficial to be there for her rather than trying to control her choices.\n\nUltimately, whether you confront your sister or inform your parents, consider the potential impact on your relationship with her and the family dynamic. Open, honest communication is key, but it should be approached with kindness and understanding.",

While it's understandable to want to focus on your reading without interruptions, responding to a curious child with such strong language can come off as unkind and dismissive. \n\nChildren often ask questions out of genuine curiosity, and while it's okay to set boundaries, there are more constructive ways to do so without resorting to harsh language. Instead of telling the child to \"fuck off,\" you could have politely explained that you were busy reading and couldn't chat at the moment. \n\nIn this situation, it seems that your friend was concerned about how you treated the child, which suggests that your reaction may not have been appropriate. So, in this case, you might be considered the \"asshole\" (AITA) for your response to the child. It's important to remember that kindness and patience can go a long way, especially with younger individuals who are still learning how to interact with others.",

It doesn't sound like you were an \"AH\" for wanting to express your feelings, but perhaps the way the conversation escalated could have been handled differently. \n\nUltimately, it seems like there were deeper issues in your relationship regarding communication and financial priorities that contributed to this situation.

This tutor, Mary(not real name) was introduced by my friend, who had her son taught by her too. However, I have a problem with the way she dresses. Mary is a splitting image of my grade school teacher back in my school days. Her facial features, her clothing style, hairstyle and everything.\n\n\nMs Lim, my grade school teacher at that time was my living nightmare. She understood her students well and knew just how to make them suffer so that she could control them. One such case was that she snapped off the branches on my flower plant when I brought it to school to show off to my classmates how well it bloomed. She did so in front of me 1 by 1 till the plant was all but a stick. Unfortunately during those days kids don't report their teachers to their parents, for fearing further punishments.\n\n\nWell I do know that Mary isn't Ms Lim, the sight of her brought back the chill in my heart and made me very uncomfortable, especially seeing that she was to teach my son. The most significant similarity was the way she wear her braids, which is quite uncommon nowadays.\n\n\nI brought this up to my husband and suggested that we change a tutor, but he shut me down and said that I was being silly and overreacting over nothing. Mary's reviews were good and her rates were better than most home tutors.\n\n\nMary makes me uncomfortable, and I know this is not her fault. I feel my heart tighten every time I leave her alone with my son. A few days ago, I mastered some courage over my fear and had a talk with Mary. I told Mary about how I felt and asked if she could maybe change the way she dresses or styles her hair when she comes to our place in future. Mary said she understood and asked me not to worry.\n\n\nThe next time Mary showed up, she looked completely different - she cut her hair. Her braid which once extended to her hips, all shortened to a bob cut, I did not expected to cut her hair. After telling my friend about this, she became angry and said that I was way out of line and shouldn't have even suggested it. My husband also disagreed with me and said that I was wrong to tell a person to change their looks.

However, asking someone to change their appearance, especially in a professional context, can be seen as inappropriate and disrespectful. \n\nWhile it's important to feel comfortable with the people who are around your child, it's also crucial to recognize that Mary is an individual with her own identity and style. Your discomfort stems from your past experiences with Ms. Lim, but projecting those feelings onto Mary may not be fair to her. \n\nYour husband and friend are likely concerned that your request could be seen as an attempt to control or judge someone based on your personal biases. It's commendable that Mary was willing to accommodate your feelings by changing her hairstyle, but it raises questions about whether that was the right thing for her to do.\n\nIn summary, while your feelings are valid, asking someone to change their appearance can be considered out of line. It might be more appropriate to focus on building a positive relationship with Mary based on her qualifications and how she interacts with your son, rather than her appearance. Therefore, you might be seen as the one in the wrong in this situation.",

            "input": "AITA for asking my son's tutor to change her hairstyle? | We recently hired a home tutor for our 10 year old son. This tutor, Mary(not real name) was introduced by my friend, who had her son taught by her too. However, I have a problem with the way she dresses. Mary is a splitting image of my grade school teacher back in my school days. Her facial features, her clothing style, hairstyle and everything.\n\n\nMs Lim, my grade school teacher at that time was my living nightmare. She understood her students well and knew just how to make them suffer so that she could control them. One such case was that she snapped off the branches on my flower plant when I brought it to school to show off to my classmates how well it bloomed. She did so in front of me 1 by 1 till the plant was all but a stick. Unfortunately during those days kids don't report their teachers to their parents, for fearing further punishments.\n\n\nWell I do know that Mary isn't Ms Lim, the sight of her brought back the chill in my heart and made me very uncomfortable, especially seeing that she was to teach my son. The most significant similarity was the way she wear her braids, which is quite uncommon nowadays.\n\n\nI brought this up to my husband and suggested that we change a tutor, but he shut me down and said that I was being silly and overreacting over nothing. Mary's reviews were good and her rates were better than most home tutors.\n\n\nMary makes me uncomfortable, and I know this is not her fault. I feel my heart tighten every time I leave her alone with my son. A few days ago, I mastered some courage over my fear and had a talk with Mary. I told Mary about how I felt and asked if she could maybe change the way she dresses or styles her hair when she comes to our place in future. Mary said she understood and asked me not to worry.\n\n\nThe next time Mary showed up, she looked completely different - she cut her hair. Her braid which once extended to her hips, all shortened to a bob cut, I did not expected to cut her hair. After telling my friend about this, she became angry and said that I was way out of line and shouldn't have even suggested it. My husband also disagreed with me and said that I was wrong to tell a person to change their looks. I feel so sorry right now, but indeed, Mary does not look like Ms Lim anymore and I am much more comfortable in her presence. AITA?",

It's understandable to want to step back from relationships that don't feel reciprocal or fulfilling. Ghosting can sometimes be seen as a harsh way to end things, but if you've communicated your feelings in the past and nothing has changed, it's reasonable to prioritize your own well-being.\n\nIf your friends aren't engaging with you or making an effort to include you, it makes sense to reevaluate those relationships. It's important to surround yourself with people who value and respect you. Just remember that while it's okay to step back, it might also be helpful to communicate your feelings to those friends if you feel comfortable doing so. This could provide closure for both you and them.\n\nIn summary, you're not necessarily an \"asshole\" for wanting to distance yourself from friendships that aren't fulfilling.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you were trying to be kind and generous by providing food to your neighbors, especially given their demanding jobs in healthcare. However, your neighbor's reaction indicates that they were feeling overwhelmed and needed some space to rest. \n\nYour initial response to their request for food was understandable, as you were celebrating a special occasion with your daughter. It\u2019s important to recognize that both your daughter's birthday and your neighbors' need for rest are valid concerns. \n\nBy bringing them cake as an apology, you showed that you care about their feelings, which is a positive step. Deciding to stop providing food after reflecting on the situation shows that you are considering their needs as well.\n\nUltimately, it doesn't seem like you are in the wrong for wanting to celebrate your daughter's birthday or for initially offering food to your neighbors. It's a matter of balancing your family's needs with those of your neighbors. If you feel comfortable, you could communicate with them to clarify your intentions and see if there\u2019s a way to continue your generosity without overwhelming them. \n\nIn conclusion, you are not the \"AITA\" (Asshole) in this situation; you were acting out of kindness, and it's understandable to feel conflicted about the response you received.",

We're both in our early 30's and live in a small-ish but expensive 2 bedroom apartment in San Diego with a small common area. My roommate is originally from the East Coast and last December she told me she was having a friend from back home flying over here that would be staying over \"for Christmas.\"\n\nI didn't initially see a problem with this because I figured that if you say someone is coming over \"for Christmas\" meant that they would be here maybe 4 or 5 days. \n\nWell, as it turns out, my roommate's friend ended up staying and crashing at our place for 14 days, from December 15th until the 28th. This pissed me off, especially considering that I did not care for this friend at all and was mad about having a third person (whom I found annoying) staying at our home for free taking up our relatively small space for half a month.\n\nAfter the friend finally left my roommate and I ended up arguing a bit and having a discussion about it, with me telling her that I thought it was absolutely egregious to have a guest over for that many days. In return she told me that in her experience if a guest was travelling across the country, it was totally normal to have said guest stay at your place for 12+ days, it happened all the time within her friend group, and she thought I was being an asshole for objecting to it. \n\nWe've mostly worked past it and talked it through, but now ten months later she wants to have another friend from the east coast over and have her stay here and crash at our place for 12 days. She says she has earned it and compromised with me by not having anyone stay over here for that long over the last 10 months, but I still think its an egregious amount of time and you can't have a guest over for that long when you live with someone who is not friends with said guest. \n\nWe've talked about it and realized that in large part it may be a class issue: me and my friends are from southern California and mostly grew up wealthy for the most part, which explains why we were not comfortable staying with people for very long and could make shorter across-the-country trips, while her and her friends grew up with almost no money at all and for them trips to San Diego were once in a lifetime experiences and its normal and polite to host them for two weeks or more.\n\nWhere does reddit stand on this issue?",
        "model_response": "This situation seems to revolve around differing expectations and cultural norms regarding hospitality and guest stays. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Communication and Boundaries**: It's essential for roommates to communicate openly about their boundaries and expectations regarding guests. If you feel uncomfortable with a guest staying for an extended period, it's important to express that clearly and respectfully.\n\n2. **Cultural Differences**: As you noted, there may be cultural differences at play. Different backgrounds can lead to varying expectations about hospitality. Your roommate may see hosting a friend for an extended period as a generous act, while you may view it as an imposition.\n\n3. **Compromise**: Finding a middle ground is crucial in any roommate situation. Perhaps you could agree on a shorter stay or set specific days when the guest can be present. This way, both parties feel heard and respected.\n\n4. **Social Norms**: While there may not be a universally accepted \"right\" or \"wrong\" duration for guest stays, many people might agree that a two-week stay is on the longer side, especially in a small apartment. It\u2019s reasonable to expect that guests should not overstay their welcome, particularly when living with someone who is not close to them.\n\n5. **Impact on Living Situation**: Consider how the presence of a guest affects your daily life. If the guest's stay disrupts your routine or comfort, it's valid to voice your concerns.\n\nIn summary, while your roommate may feel justified in hosting her friend for an extended period, it's also reasonable for you to set boundaries based on your comfort level. Open dialogue and a willingness to compromise will be key in resolving this issue amicably.",

Your response, while perhaps a bit sarcastic, was a reaction to his persistent suggestions that disregarded your feelings and circumstances.\n\nIn this case, it doesn't seem like you were in the wrong for expressing your frustration, especially since you had already communicated your stance multiple times. Your boss's support indicates that your feelings were valid, and John\u2019s comments were inappropriate given your previous discussions.\n\nYour mom's perspective suggests that she believes you could have handled it differently, but it's understandable to feel frustrated when someone doesn't respect your boundaries.

My friend Johnny hosted a party last night at his place. There were like 12 people. 5 women. This took place late into the party with a few drinks in. I was one of the two guys there without a girlfriend. Some of the women there said I\u2019m pretty hot and wanted me to rate all 5 of the women there. They think hot guys have a better eye for this. All the women agreed to it. They\u2019re all in a relationship and 3 of them had their boyfriends with them. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a Chad or anything and I also told them that I\u2019m uncomfortable rating them because I know women get jealous easily and it\u2019s my first time meeting 2 of them. The women, and later even the men, kept pressuring me. \n\n\nI thought what the heck and caved in. I told them my scale is from 0-10, mean of 5, and follows a normal distribution, so don\u2019t get upset by a low-sounding score. Jennifer, who\u2019s my friend, told me to shut up and just rate them. I started off from my left. I rated Tammy, who\u2019s also my friend, a 6. Before I could go on, Tammy asked me why the fuck I rated her so low. I told her I\u2019m not here to discuss that and hurt feelings, but rather to only dish out the numbers. The girls started laughing at Tammy. I told them again that 5 is the average and 6 is a standard deviation above. Jennifer told me to shut up again. I rated Rachel, who I met for the first time, a 7. Uproar ensued as Tammy got pissy. I then rapidfired my numbers at the end to end this quickly. I gave Jennifer an honest 5.5, Eileen, who\u2019s new to me, an 8, and Carly, who\u2019s my friend, a 7. \n\n\nThey were all tripping out about my ratings and Jennifer was the pissiest of them all. She was the only one who kept attacking me and said I must be blind or purposefully rating her the lowest because  she was the one who pressured me the most into rating them. I told her that I\u2019m dipping because I couldn\u2019t handle so much cattiness in one place. I\u2019ve been getting some flak from my friend Xavier for rating his girlfriend Jennifer the lowest because she\u2019s been pissy all day. I told him that she wanted to play a stupid game and won a stupid prize. He wants me to apologize to Jennifer, but I told him that my opinion doesn\u2019t matter and he\u2019s the one who should treat her like a princess so she doesn\u2019t go out seeking validation from other guys. Xavier said he couldn\u2019t get through to her. I told him to give her some time and she\u2019ll be fine and might even apologize to me for how she acted. I didn\u2019t get a response.",
        "model_response": "Your situation raises some interesting points about social dynamics, consent, and the impact of our words on others. While the women at the party may have initially expressed interest in having you rate them, it\u2019s important to consider the context and the potential consequences of such actions.\n\n1. **Peer Pressure**: You mentioned feeling pressured to participate in the rating game despite your discomfort. It\u2019s commendable that you recognized your unease and tried to communicate it. However, once you caved in, the situation escalated, leading to hurt feelings.\n\n2. **Honesty vs. Sensitivity**: While honesty is valuable, the way we express our opinions can significantly affect others. Ratings based on physical appearance can be particularly sensitive, especially in a social setting where emotions are involved. Your intention may not have been to hurt anyone, but the nature of the game can lead to jealousy and insecurity.\n\n3. **Reactions to Ratings**: The uproar that followed your ratings indicates that the women were not prepared for the potential emotional fallout. Even if you provided a rationale for your scores, it\u2019s clear that the ratings were taken personally, leading to conflict.\n\n4. **Friendship Dynamics**: Your friend Xavier\u2019s reaction suggests that your rating of his girlfriend has strained your relationship. It\u2019s essential to consider how your actions affect your friendships and whether it\u2019s worth standing firm on your opinion at the cost of those relationships.\n\n5. **Apologizing**: While you feel that you shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for your honest opinion, it might be worth considering whether a conversation with Jennifer could help clear the air. Apologizing for the hurt feelings, rather than the opinion itself, could demonstrate empathy without compromising your stance.\n\nIn conclusion, while you may not have intended to cause harm, the impact of your actions on others is significant. Reflecting on how to navigate social situations with sensitivity and care can help maintain friendships and foster a more positive environment.",

            "input": "AITA for giving my honest ratings on the attractiveness of each women at the party I was at? | We\u2019re all around 20 years old here. My friend Johnny hosted a party last night at his place. There were like 12 people. 5 women. This took place late into the party with a few drinks in. I was one of the two guys there without a girlfriend. Some of the women there said I\u2019m pretty hot and wanted me to rate all 5 of the women there. They think hot guys have a better eye for this. All the women agreed to it. They\u2019re all in a relationship and 3 of them had their boyfriends with them. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a Chad or anything and I also told them that I\u2019m uncomfortable rating them because I know women get jealous easily and it\u2019s my first time meeting 2 of them. The women, and later even the men, kept pressuring me. \n\n\nI thought what the heck and caved in. I told them my scale is from 0-10, mean of 5, and follows a normal distribution, so don\u2019t get upset by a low-sounding score. Jennifer, who\u2019s my friend, told me to shut up and just rate them. I started off from my left. I rated Tammy, who\u2019s also my friend, a 6. Before I could go on, Tammy asked me why the fuck I rated her so low. I told her I\u2019m not here to discuss that and hurt feelings, but rather to only dish out the numbers. The girls started laughing at Tammy. I told them again that 5 is the average and 6 is a standard deviation above. Jennifer told me to shut up again. I rated Rachel, who I met for the first time, a 7. Uproar ensued as Tammy got pissy. I then rapidfired my numbers at the end to end this quickly. I gave Jennifer an honest 5.5, Eileen, who\u2019s new to me, an 8, and Carly, who\u2019s my friend, a 7. \n\n\nThey were all tripping out about my ratings and Jennifer was the pissiest of them all. She was the only one who kept attacking me and said I must be blind or purposefully rating her the lowest because  she was the one who pressured me the most into rating them. I told her that I\u2019m dipping because I couldn\u2019t handle so much cattiness in one place. I\u2019ve been getting some flak from my friend Xavier for rating his girlfriend Jennifer the lowest because she\u2019s been pissy all day. I told him that she wanted to play a stupid game and won a stupid prize. He wants me to apologize to Jennifer, but I told him that my opinion doesn\u2019t matter and he\u2019s the one who should treat her like a princess so she doesn\u2019t go out seeking validation from other guys. Xavier said he couldn\u2019t get through to her. I told him to give her some time and she\u2019ll be fine and might even apologize to me for how she acted. I didn\u2019t get a response.",

I recently moved into a rent house in February. Prior to moving in I made an agreement with the landlord that I would clean the house, pressure wash, and take care of the yard for exchange of a discounted deposit and rent. The previous tenants of the home left without paying and left it a wreck. Anyways, the yard had been overgrown for the better part of a year, so very high grass and weeds. I don\u2019t have a huge yard but it\u2019s definitely pretty big, I\u2019d say around 30x50 combined. My across the street neighbor was friendly at first, the guy had been laid off work for 5 years and wasn\u2019t all there but we often chatted everyday when I got home from work. He was injured and let me know he gets paid about $4,000 monthly. He offered to cut my yard just like his, and his looked great for $60. I gladly paid him because after work, cleaning the house, and taking care of my daughter I was relatively busy. We had a pretty fair relationship, he would call me if he saw any body sketchy near my house, or pick up my garbage can out of the road, just neighbor stuff. Last week he asked when I wanted him to cut my grass again because it wasn\u2019t bad whatsoever. I told him that, he doesn\u2019t need to worry about it because it hasn\u2019t overgrown. I came home from work that night and it was cut so I went over and knocked and thanked him and we spoke. He asked about these boat trailers I had in the driveway that belonged to my landlord and if she was willing to sell them. I spoke with my landlord yesterday, and gave him a call this morning just letting him know the information about the trailers, he then texted me asking me if I was planning to pay him for cutting my grass last week. I didn\u2019t want to seem rude, so I agreed and asked if $20 was okay, my neighbor responded by saying he\u2019s only going to charge me $50 for it. I let him know that was a bit expensive, and I\u2019ll pay him this time but in the future I\u2019ll cut it myself. I make okay money and I\u2019m a single father, I can afford it but I don\u2019t really have the expendable income to spend on yard work I can do myself. AITA for not wanting to pay him?",
        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it seems reasonable for you to feel that you shouldn't have to pay your neighbor for cutting your grass without your prior consent. You had an agreement for him to cut the grass when it was overgrown, and you communicated that it wasn't necessary at that time. \n\nYour neighbor's decision to cut the grass without your permission and then charge you for it is not typical behavior in neighborly agreements. While it's nice that he helped you out initially, it seems he may have overstepped by doing the work without checking with you first. \n\nOffering to pay him $20 was a fair gesture, especially since you didn't ask for the service. His insistence on charging you $50 for a service you didn't request feels unreasonable, especially since you had already communicated that you would handle the yard work yourself moving forward.\n\nIn summary, you are not the one in the wrong here. It's understandable to want to manage your own yard work, especially given your circumstances as a single father. You might want to have a conversation with him to clarify your boundaries regarding yard work in the future.",

My work is pretty time consuming and requires my attention and it's very distracting to everyday have someone come over and ask for help. My landlady other neighbors have all yelled at her at some point for the same reason and she has been warned to not bother other neighbors already, but she still comes to my door and I really don't want to have to report an old lady.\n\nMost of the time I do try to help because I feel bad, but everytime I help I get stuck listening to her talk for like 5 minutes while slowly trying to leave the room. She has asked me for everything from going downstairs to open the door for a friend of hers, changing lightbulbs, checking her voicemail, changing the heat. \n\nAm I the asshole if I just decided to not answer my door if she knocks?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for any input.",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed by the frequent requests for help from your elderly neighbor. While it's commendable to want to assist her, it's also important to set boundaries for your own well-being and work commitments. \n\nNot answering the door when she knocks could be seen as a way to protect your time and space, especially if you've already tried to help her in the past. However, it might be worth considering a more compassionate approach. For example, you could have a polite conversation with her, explaining that while you want to help, you have work commitments that require your focus. You could suggest specific times when you might be available to assist her or recommend other resources she could reach out to for help.\n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance between being kind and maintaining your own boundaries. You're not necessarily an \"asshole\" for wanting to prioritize your work, but clear communication could help alleviate the situation for both of you.",

She has asked me for everything from going downstairs to open the door for a friend of hers, changing lightbulbs, checking her voicemail, changing the heat. \n\nAm I the asshole if I just decided to not answer my door if she knocks?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for any input.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems you are prioritizing your personal needs and plans, which is understandable given the context of your relationship and the effort you've made to arrange your visit. However, it's also important to consider the impact of your decision on your workplace and your colleagues, especially since they are dealing with a family loss.\n\nYour decision to go on the trip could be seen as inconsiderate to your coworkers who may need your support during a difficult time. On the other hand, you have communicated your plans in advance and have a valid reason for wanting to maintain them, especially considering your work situation and the infrequency of your time off.\n\nUltimately, whether you are \"the asshole\" (AITA) depends on the perspective of those involved. If your coworkers feel that your absence during a time of need is detrimental to the team, they may view your decision negatively. Conversely, if you believe that taking this trip is essential for your well-being and relationship, then you may feel justified in your choice.\n\nIn summary, it's a nuanced situation with valid points on both sides. Balancing personal needs with workplace responsibilities can be challenging, and it's important to weigh the potential consequences of your decision on both your personal life and your work environment.",

My paternal grandmother HATED tattoos, saying they were ugly and she didn't get why people would do that to themselves, and joked with my dad that if he ever got a tattoo she'd disown him, which we all knew wasn't true as he already had one and her other son (my uncle) had full sleeves and all over his legs, chest and back.\n\nAll 4 grandparents have passed away. My maternal grandfather went first and I got a tattoo to commemorate him (very small, about an inch long and 1/4 inch tall).

You have honored the memory of your three grandparents who appreciated or would have appreciated the tattoos, while also respecting your paternal grandmother's strong dislike for them. \n\nYour decision to wear her engagement ring as a way to remember her is a meaningful gesture that shows your love and respect for her. It sounds like you have found a balance that honors all four grandparents in a way that feels right to you.\n\nIn this situation, it seems you are not the asshole (NTA) for choosing not to get a tattoo for your paternal grandmother. You have made a personal choice based on your understanding of her feelings, and that is valid.

My paternal grandmother HATED tattoos, saying they were ugly and she didn't get why people would do that to themselves, and joked with my dad that if he ever got a tattoo she'd disown him, which we all knew wasn't true as he already had one and her other son (my uncle) had full sleeves and all over his legs, chest and back.\n\nAll 4 grandparents have passed away. My maternal grandfather went first and I got a tattoo to commemorate him (very small, about an inch long and 1/4 inch tall). My paternal grandfather said he loved the tattoo and he was the next to go, so I got one for him directly underneath the first.

Last night (friday night) my bf (21) played a bar show, he's a lead guitar player and he absolutely nailed it, it was a great show- everyone had a lovely time and we both got inebriated enough to where we couldn't drive home. We got to my house at about 12:30 fooled around for a little bit and then I went to bed  sometime around 1:15. I was drunk and tired and I had also worked that day I wanted to go to sleep and he wanted to play Apex with his friend on my PS4, fine by me! I let him play my PS4 whenever he wants to. Since Apex came out, he plays a lot. Every time he is at my house which is  very often  he plays at least 4 to 6 hours worth of Apex. Almost every night that he stays at my house he's up till at least 2am but usually three or four. I can't stay up that late. So anyway I'm asleep and he's in the room right next to me maybe 7 feet away talking in a normal conversation tone with his buddy online. the room next to me doesn't have a full wall dividing it so I can hear him as if he's in the same room next to me. I've adapted to sleep through him talking but if I'm being honest I never sleep that great. I am a light sleeper by Nature. So here's where I need your help. Last night I wake up in what I think is the middle of the night but I look at my phone and it's 5 in the morning. I have to be at work at 9 in the morning. My first thought is that he doesn't know how late it actually is. He doesn't usually stay up that late. So I get out of bed and walk over to him. I'm half drunk and half hungover, I have a headache and in general I don't feel that great. He's having a great time laughing and being very animated with his friend. I asked him if he knows that it's 5 a.m.( he later tells me that he did know) and I tell him that he should come to bed. He can't answer me because his friend is on the other side of the mic so I go back into my bed. He tells his friend to hang on and he comes over to me and I reiterate what I said once again. He agrees and then goes and turns off the PS4 without even saying goodbye to his friend. This is when I felt like I had done something wrong. I wanted him to come to bed but I wasn't requesting he get off the PS4 immediately. I usually snuggle him in bed but I just felt in general shitty and we both just fell asleep after that. I got the feeling that he was disappointed and I hated the feeling of being like his mom. He's still sleeping and he probably will be until about one or two p.m. \n\nDid I make an unreasonable request,? Reddit, AITA?",
        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it doesn't seem like you made an unreasonable request. You communicated your need for him to come to bed because it was very late, and you had to work in the morning. It's understandable that you want to get a good night's sleep, especially since you're a light sleeper and had already been feeling unwell.\n\nYour boyfriend's reaction\u2014turning off the PS4 and coming to bed\u2014indicates that he understood your request, even if it might have felt abrupt. It's natural to want to prioritize your well-being and sleep, especially when you have responsibilities the next day. \n\nIt's also important in a relationship to communicate your needs and boundaries. If his late-night gaming is consistently affecting your sleep and well-being, it might be worth discussing it further when you're both awake and in a good mood. Open communication can help both of you find a balance that works for your relationship.\n\nIn summary, your request was reasonable, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs. You are not the asshole in this situation.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it's understandable that you felt disrespected and dehumanized by the MIT's actions. His behavior was inappropriate, especially given the context of how he handled your personal belongings and the invasion of your personal space. Your reaction, while perhaps a bit extreme, was a response to feeling violated and belittled.\n\nWhen it comes to whether you should apologize to the MIT, consider the following:\n\n1. **Your Feelings Matter**: It's important to acknowledge your feelings and the impact of his actions on you. If you feel that an apology would not be genuine or would undermine your feelings, it's okay to hold off.\n\n2. **Setting Boundaries**: Ignoring him for the remainder of his time at the restaurant could be a way to establish boundaries. You don't owe him an apology if you feel he hasn't acknowledged his own inappropriate behavior.\n\n3. **Potential Outcomes**: If you do choose to apologize, think about what you hope to achieve. If it's to maintain a professional environment, that might be worth considering. However, if you feel it would be insincere or lead to further disrespect, it might be better to refrain.\n\n4. **Talk to Your Manager**: Since your manager witnessed the incident, it might be helpful to discuss your feelings with them. They can provide guidance on how to handle the situation moving forward.\n\nUltimately, you should prioritize your comfort and well-being. If you feel that not apologizing is the best course of action for you, then it's perfectly valid to stand by that decision.",

While it is understandable to feel frustrated about someone taking up space for an extended period, how you approach the situation matters.\n\nIf you were to tell the girl to stop hogging the seat, it could come off as confrontational, especially if she is not aware of how her actions are affecting others. Instead, you might consider a more polite approach, such as gently asking her if she plans to be gone for a while or if she would be willing to move her things if she knows she will be away for an extended period. This way, you express your concern without directly accusing her of wrongdoing.\n\nUltimately, whether you would be the \"asshole\" depends on your tone and approach.

        "model_response": "It's completely understandable to feel disappointed and frustrated in your situation. Relationships often require compromise and understanding, especially when one partner is dealing with challenges like social anxiety. Your feelings are valid, and it's natural to want to share experiences and create memories together.\n\nIt's important to recognize that your partner's anxiety is not something they can easily control, and it sounds like you are being supportive and understanding of their struggles. However, it's also okay to acknowledge your own feelings of disappointment. Communication is key in any relationship, so consider discussing your feelings with your partner in a gentle and understanding way. This can help both of you navigate the situation together and find ways to enjoy your time together that accommodate her needs while also addressing your desire for new experiences.\n\nUltimately, you're not an asshole for feeling the way you do. It's a complex situation that many couples face, and finding a balance between support and your own needs is essential.",

It's okay to prioritize your feelings and choose not to engage with someone who has manipulated you and your friends in such a harmful way.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours.

        "model_response": "Yes, you would be the asshole (WIBTA) if you contacted the school to \"out\" your sister as straight. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. **Respect for Autonomy**: Your sister is an adult and has the right to define her own identity. If she identifies as an ally or advocate for LGBTQ+ students, that is her choice. It\u2019s important to respect her autonomy and the way she chooses to express herself.\n\n2. **Potential Harm**: Outing someone, regardless of the context, can have serious consequences. It could damage her reputation, her career, and her relationships. You may not fully understand her motivations or the context of her actions.\n\n3. **Misunderstanding**: It seems you may not fully grasp her intentions or experiences. Just because she hasn't dated women doesn't mean she can't be an ally or support LGBTQ+ students. Many people advocate for causes they believe in without being part of that community themselves.\n\n4. **Communication**: Instead of taking drastic action, consider reaching out to your sister directly. Express your concerns in a supportive manner and try to understand her perspective. Open dialogue can often lead to better understanding and resolution.\n\n5. **Support for LGBTQ+ Youth**: Running a support group for LGBTQ+ students can be incredibly valuable. If your sister is providing a safe space for these students, that is commendable and should be supported, not undermined.\n\nIn summary, it\u2019s important to approach this situation with care and empathy rather than taking actions that could harm your sister.",

It wasn't the landlords responsibility because we had bought and installed the dishwasher ourselves - so it was considered \"our\" problem. Sister said yes. \n\nFast forward to last year and my sister lost her job of 7 years and then lost the replacement job she got due to some illnesses she was going through. Her old job let her go saying she wasn't working up to par and then her new job lied to her, said they didn't require medical certificates and then fired her for not providing medical certificates. So - while waiting for government assistance which took her 2 months - she quickly blew through her savings on rent and bills. \n\nShe was trying to borrow money for rent and our parents offered to pay for 3 months of rent - and she pay them back when she can. After they paid the money - they were quick to change their minds and set up various terms and conditions for the loan. They wanted access to my sisters bank account so that they could control how much she was spending, and wanted my sister to stop going to the basketball team she was on (and had been on for several years that was helping her mental health and keep her physically in shape) for at least a year until she had paid them back, paid her debt (which total would only take 3 months seeing as she got a new, better paying, supportive job at the start of this year), and had 3000 dollars in savings. They wanted complete access to her bank account until all that occured. \n\nSo my sister obviously didn't like that - but because she had already accepted the money and they'd paid it, she wasn't sure what to do. She then had an idea and asked if she could \"call it even\" from the dishwasher she bought (and still had the receipt for) from ages ago. They have now been screaming at her for the last hour about how selfish she is and that buying the dishwasher was her being a good child and 'paying her way' for living there as an adult and are now demanding MORE conditions for her accepting this loan. So - is sister the asshole for even suggesting this - and is sister the asshole now if she (as she is currently telling me she wants to do) just stops talking to my parents in a couple of days because of it all?",
        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it seems that your sister is not the asshole for suggesting that the money she spent on the dishwasher be considered as a form of repayment for the loan your parents provided. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Context of the Dishwasher Purchase**: Your sister was asked to help out with a household expense when she was younger, and she did so willingly. It was a one-time request, and it seems unreasonable for your parents to hold that over her head as a form of debt repayment years later.\n\n2. **Current Financial Situation**: Your sister is going through a tough time financially, having lost her job and facing health issues. It's understandable that she would want to negotiate the terms of repayment, especially when the conditions set by your parents seem controlling and unreasonable.\n\n3. **Parental Control**: The demands your parents are making regarding access to her bank account and the stipulation that she stop participating in activities that benefit her mental health are concerning. This level of control can be detrimental to her well-being.\n\n4. **Communication Breakdown**: It sounds like there has been a significant breakdown in communication and understanding between your sister and your parents. If they are reacting with anger rather than empathy, it may be indicative of deeper issues in their relationship.\n\n5. **Setting Boundaries**: If your sister feels that her parents are being unreasonable and controlling, it is her right to set boundaries. If she decides to stop talking to them as a means of self-preservation, that is a valid choice.\n\nIn conclusion, your sister's suggestion to consider the dishwasher purchase as a form of repayment is not selfish; rather, it seems like a reasonable request given the circumstances. If she feels that her relationship with her parents is causing her more harm than good, taking a step back may be a healthy decision for her.",

It's not that strong, but still noticeable. My gf tells me that they do \"everything the can\" to minimize the smell, but when I go to the cat's litter box, it's far too small (<10cm in height) and has so little sand in there that the poor cat can't even hide the turds. There's no way, there's so little sand that there are spots where there is none. The cat basically has to unbury a turd to hide another. Almost everytime I go there, I say out loud \"ouh, that smell...\" and sometimes I even said to my gf that she should put more sand in the litter box. Once I even poured sand that they had in the box and the smell vanished.\n\nWell, knowing that problem they had, today I said to my gf \"let's buy a generic box and a lot of sand\". We got shopping and I carefully selected a big box with +-15cm in height and which was pretty big in size. Then I proceeded and bought 3 packs with 4kg sand each. After some time we went back to her home, I greetet everyone with \"Look what I bought!\", put the litter box on the table, opened a pack, poured the whole in there, making 4cm of sand, which was the recom. min. amount of sand. \nHer mum looked at that whole package being gone and said \"gf, that's too much sand, put a little bit back into the pack\", to which I replied \"Nah, that is the recom. amount. The cat must bury her necessities that's why it stank.\" The answer was exactly the same again \"Put some back into the pack.\"\nWhile walking out with the box, I (jokingly) answered \"Nah, if you guys want to be cheap with sand I go get buy more.\"\nI then heard her dad mumble something, but since I didn't understand a word, I moved on.\nWhen I came back, her dad wasn't on the couch anymore, and I heard a loud thump coming from slamming a door.\nAs it turned out (gf told me), her dad said \"Say to your bf he should watch his mouth\" and then almost immediately following with \"I will retire myself\" and then slam his bedroom door.\nI then looked to my gf and asked what's happening, and her response basically was: \"Hey, you were mean and said unnecessary things. They know it and it's inconvenient.\"\nI then just said to her \"You dad is just too serious\", to which she said \"No, you were inconvenient. My parents loved the attitude, but saying those things and calling my parents cheap isn't the right thing to do\". I then told her that I was joking, but apparently it wasn't received well.\nI then felt pretty unwelcomed there and asked to go home.\n\nI know I shouldn't have said exactly what I said, but I did a favor, bought things for a cat that isn't even mine, etc\n\nMy gf even said in the car \"You also wouldn't like it if someone comes into your home, telling that things are smelling bad, etc\", to which I replied: \"I wouldn't mind, even less if the person buys stuff for me.\" to which she disagreed.",
        "model_response": "Based on the situation you've described, it seems that your intentions were good in trying to help improve the living conditions for the cat. However, the way you communicated your concerns and the jokes you made may have come off as disrespectful to your girlfriend's parents. \n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Intent vs. Impact**: While you intended to help, the impact of your words and actions was negative. Your girlfriend's parents may have felt criticized or embarrassed by your comments, especially in front of others.\n\n2. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Different families have different dynamics and ways of handling situations. What might seem like a harmless joke to you could be taken seriously by someone else. It's important to be sensitive to the feelings of others, especially in someone else's home.\n\n3. **Communication Style**: Joking about someone's financial situation or calling them \"cheap\" can be hurtful, even if it's meant in jest. It's often better to approach such topics with care and to focus on the positive aspects of your help rather than making comments that could be perceived as negative.\n\n4. **Apologizing**: If you feel that your comments were inappropriate, it might be worth considering an apology to your girlfriend's parents. Acknowledging that your words may have hurt them can go a long way in mending the situation.\n\n5. **Discussing with Your Girlfriend**: It's important to have an open conversation with your girlfriend about how both of you view the situation. Understanding her perspective can help you navigate similar situations in the future.\n\nIn summary, while your actions were well-intentioned, the way you expressed your concerns may have crossed a line. It's important to be mindful of how your words can affect others, especially in sensitive situations.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you are asking for a fee for returning a lost item, which can be seen as questionable. While you may argue that your employee put in effort to locate and return the phone, demanding money for the return of someone's property can come off as exploitative, especially since the girl was already grateful for the return of her phone.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Ethics of Charging for Lost Property**: While it's understandable that you want to compensate your employee for their effort, charging a fee for returning lost property can be perceived as taking advantage of someone in a vulnerable situation. Many people might expect that a business would return lost items without a fee, especially if the item is valuable.\n\n2. **Transparency**: The girl expressed skepticism about whether the money would actually go to your employee. This indicates a lack of trust in your intentions, which could harm your reputation. If you want to implement a system to reward employees for their efforts, it might be better to do so in a more transparent way, such as a tip jar or a reward system that doesn't involve charging customers directly.\n\n3. **Customer Experience**: Consider how this interaction might affect your customers' perception of your bar. If people feel that they are being charged unfairly, it could deter them from returning or recommending your establishment.\n\n4. **Legal Considerations**: Depending on local laws, there may be regulations regarding the handling of lost property and whether a business can charge for its return. It's worth looking into these laws to ensure compliance.\n\nIn summary, while you may not have intended to be unfair, demanding money for returning a lost phone can be seen as wrong by many. It might be more beneficial to find alternative ways to reward your employees without putting your customers in an uncomfortable position. Therefore, in this case, you might be considered the \"asshole\" (AITA) for demanding the $20.",

We are both canadians who reside in the UK; as such we have many people staying with us.

He had asked her previously if it was fine for for a period two months later. I was fine with that time but not the dates right after birth as I am not entitled to parental leave and must use my holidays. I wanted this time for just our family. Our place would also be full as her mother is staying with us to help. My wife told me to message him if I didn't want him here, so I did. I lied periodically throughout the message to try and take any blame for the incident. \nHeres the message :\n\"\nHey Thommy.\nMary just told me that you were planning on coming the first couple of weeks in May. I had misunderstood what she had previously said when she told me the 5th.

        "model_response": "Your feelings about wanting to have a private time with your family after the birth of your child are completely valid. It's a significant moment, and many parents prefer to have that time to bond without additional guests. However, the way you handled the situation\u2014particularly the dishonesty in your message\u2014may have contributed to the fallout with your wife's friend.\n\nIt's understandable that you wanted to protect your family's space during such a personal time, but being truthful and direct about your feelings might have led to a different outcome. Instead of lying and shifting blame, expressing your desire for privacy and the importance of that time for your family could have fostered a more understanding response.\n\nUltimately, while it's not wrong to want that time for your family, the approach you took may have caused unnecessary hurt and tension. It might be worth discussing this with your wife and considering how to navigate friendships and boundaries in the future, especially during such a pivotal moment in your lives. Communication is key, and being honest about your feelings can help maintain relationships while also prioritizing your family's needs.",

We are both canadians who reside in the UK; as such we have many people staying with us. I recently got upset because my wife had said she was OK with a friend staying with us during the two weeks after she gave birth. He had asked her previously if it was fine for for a period two months later. I was fine with that time but not the dates right after birth as I am not entitled to parental leave and must use my holidays. I wanted this time for just our family. Our place would also be full as her mother is staying with us to help. My wife told me to message him if I didn't want him here, so I did. I lied periodically throughout the message to try and take any blame for the incident. \nHeres the message :\n\"\nHey Thommy.\nMary just told me that you were planning on coming the first couple of weeks in May.

Some of these sets have been discontinued for ages and are impossible to find, and are largely dependent on somebody being willing to give them up, which is almost never. I came across a rare set tonight.\n\nSo tonight I was at my local game store for FNM. A 17 year old guy came in and had a block of dice that usually gets used for counters in M:tG. When I was paired up against him I noticed that they were actually a very rare set of dice that have been discontinued for 16 years now and are very valuable. I asked to see them and as soon as I looked I knew exactly what they were. I started telling him about the dice, how they're rare and valuable to collectors, why they're so special and their history, and how much they're roughly worth, as I didn't remember the exact going price. He seemed surprised but excited that he had something so special. I then asked if he'd possibly be willing to sell me some of them, and he agreed. I wanted to check what the going price for them was because I wanted to be fair; he may not value them the way that I do, but I don't want to take advantage of somebody just because they're not a collector since that\u2019s not cool.\n\nI couldn't find any older ebay searches, so I consulted an FB group I'm in to ask the going rate and specified I was trying to buy from a non-collector and wanted to give him a fair deal. I ended up getting the rough going rate and we agreed on a price, and I bought 9 of these dice from him for $180. That might sound like a lot for these dice but boy howdy welcome to collecting, one of the most valuable polyhedral sets goes for close to $1k now due to demand. We're big sweaty nerds, I get it.\n\nHe has 3/4 of the block left so if he ever wanted to collect as well, he has more than enough to work with in the future, and the knowledge I gave him so nobody tries to take advantage of him in the future. He seemed excited to be able to buy some cards he wanted with the money I gave him, and excited that he also found out he has something so special.\n\nHowever, on my FB post, I got a few comments saying it was taking advantage to even try to buy them from him in the first place, and I was an asshole for doing it even if I paid him what I'd pay an informed collector, and because I'm older than him (I'm 25). I felt because I was older and more informed that being clear with him and paying him fairly would be enough, but now I'm not sure if the dynamics here were poor and I was an asshole about this. I'm super anxious and I've got bad shakes thinking that maybe I hurt somebody with this even if they seemed happy with the deal, so I guess I wanted to know for sure from this sub.\n\nAITA for buying these dice?",
        "model_response": "Based on the information you've provided, it doesn't seem like you are the asshole in this situation. You approached the transaction with transparency and fairness, informing the 17-year-old about the value of the dice and ensuring that you paid a fair price based on the current market value. \n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Informed Consent**: You made sure the seller was aware of the value of what he was selling. This is important in any transaction, especially when there is a significant difference in knowledge about the item being sold.\n\n2. **Fair Pricing**: You took the time to research the going rate for the dice and agreed on a price that was fair. This shows that you were not trying to exploit the situation.\n\n3. **Positive Outcome**: The seller seemed excited about the deal and was able to use the money to buy cards he wanted. This indicates that he was satisfied with the transaction.\n\n4. **Collector's Market**: In the world of collectibles, transactions often involve individuals with varying levels of knowledge. As long as both parties agree on the terms and are satisfied with the outcome, it is a legitimate transaction.\n\nWhile some people may feel that there is an ethical concern due to the age difference and the knowledge disparity, your actions demonstrate that you were considerate and fair. It's natural to feel anxious about how others perceive your actions, but it seems like you handled the situation well. Therefore, you are not the asshole in this scenario.",

But she's also very annoying and rude at other times. Something that's been pissing me off lately is the fact that she never focuses with me. Wheather I am telling her a story, or showing her something, or teaching her something, she doesn't focus. She claims she is focusing with me with her ears and understands perfectly. I always tell her that it annoys me when she does that because I feel like she isn't focusing. For a while now, I've been teaching her to play songs on the guitar. This is the best way we bond and I really enjoy it. The only problem is that she only focuses with her ears and not her eyes, that way, I can't tell the difference between \"I can hear and understand you\" and \"I wasn't focusing\". So I politely ask her to stop. Eventually (as usual) I lose my temper and yell like a school teacher to her loud students. She apologises and everything is fine. But that's not the problem. A while ago, I did something I was really proud of. I went to the living room to show my sister and she was only focusing with her hearing (I was playing guitar). I understood that she was focusing with me because it happens a lot. But I soon realized she was looking at the computer we share. I lost my temper and left before I can finish what I wanted to show her. She apologized and I didn't forgive her.

It's understandable to want to be heard and acknowledged, especially when you're putting effort into teaching her something you love. \n\nFrom what you've described, it seems like your sister may not fully understand how her behavior affects you, and that could be a source of tension between you two. Losing your temper is a natural reaction when you feel ignored, but it might be helpful to communicate your feelings to her in a calm way, so she understands the impact of her actions.\n\nAs for whether you're the \"A-hole,\" it seems like you're recognizing that forgiveness is important, and you're planning to move forward. It's okay to feel upset, but holding onto that frustration might not be the best for your relationship. It could be beneficial to have a conversation with her about how you both can improve communication and focus during your time together. This way, you can both work towards a better understanding and strengthen your bond.",

When we got there, he wanted to see if we could watch airplanes land and take off. We couldn't see any from the windows in the ticketing and terminal areas. So I approached the TSA transportation security officer manning the place where they check your license. I showed him my license and he asked for my boarding pass. I stated that I did not have one and that we were just hoping to sit in the concourse and watch some airplanes take off and land. The TSA officer stated that I needed a boarding pass to be let into the part of the airport past the TSA security checkpoints. He then went further and stated that if I didn't have one and didn't plan to buy one, we needed to leave the airport immediately. So we left. \n\nI thought this was ridiculous. I showed my driver's license. And we would've gone through the usual TSA security theater (including us, there were maybe a dozen people in the airport, so it's not like we were holding anyone up).  And the risk of me somehow sneaking onto an airplane with my three-year-old and a stroller would've been very remote, given that airlines check your boarding passes a separate time before they let passengers board the plane. \n\nThe only basis I can think of for TSA refusing us entry is that there's some federal statute or TSA regulation (or other TSA security procedure) requiring anyone who wants to be in the airport concourse to have a boarding pass on their person at all times, even if they just want to go there to buy a slice of Sbarro's pizza at the airport food court.

However, the TSA regulations are in place for security reasons, and they require individuals to have a boarding pass to access the concourse area beyond the security checkpoint. \n\nWhile it may feel unreasonable, especially given the low traffic at the airport during your visit, the TSA officer was following established protocols. These rules are designed to ensure the safety and security of all passengers and airport personnel. \n\nIn terms of whether you are the \"AITA\" (Am I The Asshole) in this scenario, it appears that you were not in the wrong for wanting to spend time with your son in a safe and enjoyable way. However, it is also important to recognize that the TSA has to enforce their regulations consistently, regardless of individual circumstances. \n\nSo, while your intentions were good, the TSA's response was in line with their security policies. Therefore, you are not the asshole for wanting to share that experience with your son, but it\u2019s also understandable that the TSA had to adhere to their rules.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and unhappy with the direction your wife's request has taken. While it's commendable that you agreed to make the year about her as a way to rebuild trust after your affair, it's also important to recognize that both partners' needs and feelings should be considered in a relationship.\n\nYour wife's desire to focus on Disney may stem from her own coping mechanisms or a way to find joy after a difficult time, but it seems that this has become a source of stress for you. It's not wrong to want to communicate your feelings and seek a balance that works for both of you. \n\nHaving an open and honest conversation about your feelings, and suggesting counseling as a way to address both of your needs, is a reasonable approach. It's important to express that while you want to support her, you also need to take care of your own well-being. \n\nIn summary, wanting to back out of the promise in favor of a more balanced approach that includes counseling is not inherently wrong. It's about finding a way to navigate this situation together. Communication is key, and addressing both of your needs can lead to a healthier relationship moving forward.",

        "model_response": "Based on the context you've provided, it seems that you're feeling overwhelmed and are seeking support from your stepdaughters, especially given the challenges of managing your household and caring for your children. \n\nAsking your stepdaughters to help babysit is not inherently wrong, especially if you communicate your needs clearly and respectfully. However, it's important to consider a few factors:\n\n1. **Expectations and Boundaries**: Make sure to set clear expectations about what you need help with and how often. It's also important to respect their boundaries and commitments, especially since they are young adults with their own lives.\n\n2. **Communication**: Approach the conversation with understanding. Express your feelings and the challenges you're facing, and ask for their support rather than demanding it. This can help them feel more willing to help.\n\n3. **Reciprocity**: Consider how you can make it a mutually beneficial arrangement. Perhaps you can offer to help them in some way in return, whether it's with chores or other support.\n\n4. **Their Perspective**: Keep in mind that they may have their own feelings about the situation, especially if they feel pressured or if they have a complicated relationship with their father or the family dynamics.\n\nIn summary, asking for help is reasonable given your circumstances, but how you approach the request can make a significant difference in how it is received. If you communicate openly and respectfully, you are less likely to be seen as the \"asshole\" in this situation.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it would be reasonable to discuss the ticket with your friend, but asking him to pay the entire amount might come off as unfair, especially since you were the owner of the car and ultimately responsible for it. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Shared Responsibility**: Since you were in the car and chose to let him drive, there is a shared responsibility. However, you also acknowledge that you were not paying attention to the speed limit, which complicates the situation.\n\n2. **Nature of the Agreement**: If there was an understanding that he would be driving your car and you were okay with that, it might be seen as part of the arrangement. However, it\u2019s important to communicate openly about expectations regarding any potential consequences, like tickets.\n\n3. **Splitting the Cost**: Asking him to split the ticket could be a more reasonable approach. This way, both of you share the responsibility for the situation, and it acknowledges that he was driving at the time.\n\n4. **Friendship Dynamics**: Consider how this request might affect your friendship. If he feels unfairly burdened by the ticket, it could lead to tension. Approach the conversation with understanding and be open to his perspective.\n\n5. **Future Considerations**: Use this experience as a learning opportunity for future arrangements. If you ask someone to drive your car again, it might be worth discussing how to handle any potential tickets or issues beforehand.\n\nIn summary, while it\u2019s not unreasonable to discuss the ticket with your friend, asking him to pay the entire amount might be seen as unfair. A more balanced approach, like suggesting to split the cost, could lead to a better outcome for both of you.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems like there are a few key factors to consider. While your desire for a special wedding is understandable, the car holds sentimental value for your fianc\u00e9, as it was left to him by his father. This emotional attachment can make it difficult for him to see the car purely as an asset that could be sold.\n\nYour perspective on wanting to sell the car to fund a memorable wedding is valid, especially since you both are facing financial constraints. However, it's important to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding of his feelings. Instead of insisting on selling the car, perhaps you could explore other options together, such as finding a compromise that respects both your desires for the wedding and his attachment to the car.\n\nUltimately, communication and compromise are key in any relationship. It might be helpful to have an open discussion about both of your priorities and find a solution that works for both of you. This way, you can work together towards your wedding while also respecting his feelings about the car.",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems like both you and your girlfriend have valid points, but the key issue is communication and understanding each other's needs. \n\nYou have a natural tendency to walk faster due to your height, and you prefer to move quickly when running errands. On the other hand, your girlfriend may feel overwhelmed trying to keep up with your pace, which can lead to frustration for both of you.\n\nInstead of viewing it as a matter of who is at fault, it might be more productive to find a compromise. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Adjust Your Pace**: Try to be more mindful of her pace when walking together. Slowing down a bit could make the experience more enjoyable for both of you.\n\n2. **Plan Ahead**: Before going out, discuss your plans and agree on a pace that works for both of you. This could help set expectations and reduce frustration.\n\n3. **Take Breaks**: If you're in a hurry, consider taking short breaks to allow her to catch up without feeling rushed.\n\n4. **Communicate**: Talk openly about how you both feel during these outings. Understanding each other's perspectives can help you find a solution that works for both of you.\n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance that respects both your needs and preferences. So, in this case, neither of you is necessarily the \"bad guy,\" but rather, it's an opportunity for growth in your relationship.",

However, labeling someone as an \"asshole\" can be subjective and depends on various perspectives.\n\nYour sister's decision not to visit your father may stem from her complex feelings about him and the situation, which could be influenced by her past experiences and emotions. It's possible that she is struggling with her own feelings of forgiveness and the implications of visiting someone who has committed serious crimes.\n\nWhile you may feel justified in your anger, it's important to consider her perspective as well. Open communication about your feelings and the importance of family connections might help both of you navigate this difficult situation.

They have a son, 10mo. It was our daughter's birthday two weeks ago and we hired a photographer to take photos. All of our friends and their children (anywhere from 4mo-3yr) came, including the titular friend. We had photos of each kid, each kid beside the cake, even some group shots. But we told our photographer to exclude our friend's son from specific photos. He still got lots of photos, but none with our daughter, he wasn't in the group shot, et cetera.\n\nWhy? Their son has a physical disability. Some sort of musculo-skeletal thing, we don't know the name and never asked. His face is perpetually grinning with his lips almost in a caricaturized way. Whether they plan to get corrective surgery I don't know. To put it blunt (and this might be point one where we're the assholes), he's unsightly. We didn't want him in photos we planned to hang around the house or put in our album because, to be frank, he ruins any photo he's in. \n\nHis face is unfortunate and it's not his fault, but we paid for the photographer to take nice photos, stuff we could put up, and him being in any of them was impossible. He still got lots of photos, everyone did, and we forwarded them all to our friends, it's just in those specific photos we wanted to put up, we asked the photographer to frame him out of them or just exclude him entirely.\n\nNo one has questioned anything because no one knows the reasoning. According to everyone else, everything is hunky dory, nothing out of the ordinary happened with the photographer. But are we the assholes?",
        "model_response": "Yes, you are the assholes in this situation. Excluding a child from photos based on their appearance, especially due to a physical disability, is not only insensitive but also discriminatory. It reflects a lack of empathy and understanding towards the challenges that the child and their family may face. \n\nPhotographs are meant to capture moments and memories, and intentionally excluding someone because of how they look sends a harmful message about acceptance and inclusion. It\u2019s important to recognize that every child deserves to be included and celebrated, regardless of their appearance or abilities. \n\nIf you were concerned about how the photos would look, it would have been more appropriate to discuss your feelings with the child's parents rather than making a decision that could hurt them and their child. In this case, your actions could be seen as prioritizing aesthetics over kindness and compassion.",
