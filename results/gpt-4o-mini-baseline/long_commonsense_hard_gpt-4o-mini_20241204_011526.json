Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns.

We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not inviting my brother to son's birthday? | I was trying to avoid conflict, but I don't know if I made things worse in doing so.\n\nThe thing is, my husband and brother don't get along. My brother is gay, husband is on the religious side and doesn't like it when my brother brings his partner for family reunions or events. They're both stubborn though, so they can't even play nice for the sake of others. They usually end up either arguing or passively-aggressively avoiding each other. I didn't want them to find a reason to fight during our son's birthday party. For context, son just turned 4 and we invited some relatives and friends over to celebrate.\n\nTherefore I didn't tell my brother about the celebration because I know him - he'd want to visit despite the fact that my husband and he would find some way to make a scene, like they do every time. We held the birthday party with my in-laws and a few neighborhood kids. When my brother asked about bringing a present after work, I told him to come then and didn't mention the party. That way no-one would be hurt, son would get to hang out with his uncle, and there would be no needless arguing (husband works afternoon shifts, they wouldn't meet).\n\nHowever, my brother found out through a conversation with our parents about the party and now he won't talk to me or come over to see his nephew. He's convinced I'm taking husband's side and trying to turn son against him and his partner. I'm not though; I just didn't want their petty fighting to ruin my kid's birthday. He doesn't need to be a part of that.\n\nWas I the asshole for my behavior here? Honestly, I don't believe so and I think he's being selfish in putting the disagreements with my husband before his nephew.\"\"\"",

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d?

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for refusing to buy my child diapers and other baby stuff? | My ex and I have a toddler together.

We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d?

I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes.

AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely.

I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for calling my wife\u2019s friend a snob? | Me/wife (Wendy): 30s m/f\n\nFriend (Francie): 30s f\n\nWendy and Francie have been friends since they were in college, so about half their lives.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for being naked in my apartment when I knew a friend was coming over? | So, I need your guys\u2019 help, because I\u2019m honestly not sure if I\u2019m the asshole here or not.\n\nSo, this happened a couple months ago.

We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do.

I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling.

Verdict: wrong, as it disregards the sentimental value of the gift.\n\n2. **Revealing Family Secrets**: A person disclosed their brother's past addiction to their children, leading to family conflict. Verdict: wrong, as it breached trust and privacy.\n\n3. **Financial Support in a Relationship**: A student is financially supporting her partner but can no longer afford to do so. Verdict: not wrong, as she needs to prioritize her financial stability.\n\n4. **Reporting a Bus Driver**: A parent reported a bus driver for perceived rudeness towards their autistic child. Verdict: wrong, as it may have been an overreaction without sufficient evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n5. **Gift Giving After Exclusion**: A person feels hurt after being excluded from a family dinner and is reconsidering a gift for the brother.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off.

I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not canceling a planned trip to see friends out of state while wife\u2019s dad is on his death bed, and not expected to make it past the weekend | Obvious throwaway, so my father in law has been hospice for 3 years because of his Alzheimer\u2019s, and This would be the fourth canceled  trip in that time frame because of him \u201cdieing\u201d one was a surprise birthday getaway for the wife because he had pneumonia, Second because he had a UTI and was expected to not make it, third, first weekend get away with the wife without kids because he had a fever and you guessed not expected to live.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"I was very proud of the SAT test scores I got for myself.\"\"\"",

I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for being angry that my restaurant left me out of their Gofundme for it's staff after I had given my notice but didn't end up leaving? | I worked in a restaurant in Chicago.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

They spend all their free time getting drunk.\n\nIf they went home they would being going home to a large family and friend support network and would be able to move forward with their life.\n\nI have lived with said flatmate for almost a year and during that time have been subject to a lot of bullying and generally unpleasant behaviour from that flatmate. They also suffer from depression and anxiety which they self medicate with booze, making them unbearable to be around.\n\nI hadn't considered it before but am tempted to report them for overstaying their visa and being in the country illegally. Even if it just encourages them to sort out a proper visa (not out of the question). Worst case they will get sent home where they will be well looked after by their family.\n\nSo reddit, WIBTA if I reported my flatmate for overstaying their visa?",

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do.

Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine?

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d?

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes.

AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life.

I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely.

He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for laughing at my wife's monkey misfortune? | My wife and I went for a walk today.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"I hit her at the party.\"\"\"",

They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using).

My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me.

Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

While he has chosen to distance himself from the family due to past conflicts, your relationship with him seems to be different, and he has expressed that he still loves you. Since you plan to respect his wishes regarding your parents and are not intending to pressure him, it\u2019s reasonable to believe that he might appreciate the gesture. However, it\u2019s important to consider how he might feel about a surprise visit, as he may still be navigating his feelings about family interactions.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes.

I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d?

I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love.

Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my mate's girlfriend to act her age? | Obligatory \"this is a throwaway\" and \"I'm on mobile\" disclaimers. \n\nSituation is basically exactly what the title says.

It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for asking my in-laws to not sleep in our bed when we\u2019re out of town? | My in-laws are coming down to take the dog so that my wife and I can take a weekend trip w/ the baby - so they\u2019re doing us a favor.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for putting my foot down with regards to my debt situation with my fianc\u00e9? | For some background, I'm 24f, and my fianc\u00e9 is 28m.

Due to some poor choices on my end, I ended up with nearly $100,000 in debt which is a huge burden for me to carry.\n\nGiven the circumstances and the ridiculous rates I have to pay, not to mention its effect on my credit score and upward mobility from a career perspective, we've largely agreed that he'll pay things off once we settle down which is his family's way of telling us to get married.\n\nWith the wedding less than 3 months away, he's getting cold feet.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine?

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes.

AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private.

If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling.

However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do.

Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please.

It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d?

I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for trying to get the cleaner to change shifts? | I always stay late to do the reports and the cleaner starts hoovering as soon as everyone leaves.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling a stranger waiting for my parking spot, I didn\u2019t want them to have it? | This Saturday, my girlfriend (25f) and I (24m) went a farmer\u2019s market in the downtown area of a busy commuter city.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d?

I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike.

One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not caring about a coworker's miscarriage. | I have this coworker, let's call her Sally. \n \n Sally always gets off work early, gets longer lunch breaks, and constantly makes excuses because she had a miscarriage 25 years ago(older than me).

We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off.

I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using).

My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me.

The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for refusing to shout my friend a non vegetarian meal? | My friend was helping me move house the other day, and after some heavy lifting and a couple of trips to and fro in my rented van we were obviously pretty hungry.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money.

I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him.

So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month.

It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d?

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for not being my little sister's bridesmaid and refusing to go to the \"ceremony\"? | My (f25) little sister Emma(19) and her fianc\u00e9 Joe(27) are getting married and invited me to be a bridesmaid.

I obviously didn't do that.\n\nI told my sister I couldn't get a recommend and she said \"that's fine you can watch all the kids outside of the temple\" and I didn't want to at first but I agreed since it would be her wedding day.

She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission.

You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work.

This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

She got very upset about that, and started to argue a lot about how she didn't expect NO help, just not a lot, and her dog will live for at least another 5 years, did I expect we'll never live with each other until then. I told her no but right now I value the freedom that I have not caring for another creature. I also said if it changed in either direction, I become more okay with it, or I realize I'll never be okay with it, I'd let her know immediately. She didn't like that either. \n\nSome of her friends have pulled the \"wHaT aBoUt WhEn yOu HaVe KiDs?\" but obviously my kids would be  a totally different thing for me, and I've shut it down each time she's tried to argue that. Others think I'm some dog hating monster, which isn't true either. I know that this is a compatibility issue and maybe we need to just break up, so I'd rather not hear that over and over since neither of us seem ready to pull the plug yet, but yeah. AITA?",

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"I hid my diabetic children's insulin from them until Christmas morning.\"\"\"",

We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

I checked on my wife and she was sleeping- I refilled her water and left her a note. Throughout the day I called and sent her messages and my mom took her over some homemade soup and checked on her. We were gone the majority of the day but the kids came home worn out and we crashed in the den again. I checked on my wife as soon as we got home and she was looking better. Sunday morning, the kids and I woke up early, did some yardwork then went to the store to do the weekly grocery shopping. When we got home my wife was up and about and still weak but feeling better. However, she was being really short with me and was in a bad mood. I thought it was just bc she didn't feel well but after a few hours of her making snide comments I asked her if something was wrong and she exploded on me that her family abandoned her while she was sick. She went off about how she always takes care of us when we're sick but we avoided her like the plague and didn't stay home and I made the cleaning lady and my mom take care of her instead of doing it myself. I tried to explain that I didn't want to expose the kids to being sick and I didn't want them around the house being loud while she was trying to rest and I checked on her multiple times. She said I should've sent the kids to my parents or something and stayed home and she can't believe I didn't sleep with her for 3 days. I starting getting angry and told her that I did what I thought was best and she sounded ungrateful bc it wasn't exactly what she would've done. She then called me an asshole. We went to bed angry and didn't really speak this morning. I keep stewing over this bc I don't think that I'm an asshole but maybe I am?",

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"My doctor gave me medication for my pain, so I started taking it.\"\"\"",

She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food.

Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission.

S has known E since middle school, and I've known E for about as long as I've known S (7 years). Shes been a very amazing friend to us and we are beyond heartbroken that shes gone. Sometimes I wake up wondering if any of this is real. Ever since her death I've been isolating myself (apart from work obviously). I've been a bit avoidant when it comes to talking (not inviting S over as much) but literally everything reminds me of E and it's taking over me at this point. But on the other hand, S... literally seems like she doesn't care at ALL about E. I've tried speaking to her about it because i THOUGHT it was hard on us both, but she literally pretends as if E doesn't exist and literally ignores me when I bring her up. And all shes been doing is partying and whoring herself (and I suspect she may be doing drugs AND drinking) until this March according to her lack of party posting on social mefia, and I find it incredibly disturbing. She was closer to E than she was to me, so I don't understand why shes behaving this way. She moved on so quickly (I never saw her cry, or even discuss her ever since she died), even though it's literally been just TWO months. Anyways, over the few times shes came to my house after E died, everytime she comes she criticizes me about my behavior and says I \"need to lighten up a little\".

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off.

My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting.

The duplex is laid out with two bedrooms up stairs with a bathroom in the middle. Downstairs is the living room, kitchen, dining room and roomates room and her own bathroom. \n\nWhen we picked rooms I picked first because I moved in first and then my roommate upstairs picked and then the girl downstairs. She wasn\u2019t too happy with her room because it was the smallest and the location but settled because she had her own bathroom. \n\nSo the roommate downstairs has a very weird schedule. Sometimes she works nights and sometimes mornings. Sometimes she has 5 hour days and other days she can work 13. So obviously with the constant changing work schedule her sleeping schedule has became very weird and erratic and we never know when she\u2019s asleep now. \n\nSo since I can never guess when she\u2019s asleep I often so downstairs in the kitchen and make food and play music on my speaker while I meal prep. It\u2019s apart of my routine through out the day that i really enjoy since I don\u2019t work till 2pm. \n\nBut yesterday my roommate downstairs texted our group chat and asked us to please stop playing music in the kitchen at any time of the day. She said it wakes her up almost every time and when she is a wake it\u2019s just very disruptive. My other roommate said sure but I said that\u2019s not really fair because she often plays music too in the kitchen.

The duplex is laid out with two bedrooms up stairs with a bathroom in the middle. Downstairs is the living room, kitchen, dining room and roomates room and her own bathroom. \n\nWhen we picked rooms I picked first because I moved in first and then my roommate upstairs picked and then the girl downstairs. She wasn\u2019t too happy with her room because it was the smallest and the location but settled because she had her own bathroom. \n\nSo the roommate downstairs has a very weird schedule. Sometimes she works nights and sometimes mornings. Sometimes she has 5 hour days and other days she can work 13. So obviously with the constant changing work schedule her sleeping schedule has became very weird and erratic and we never know when she\u2019s asleep now. \n\nSo since I can never guess when she\u2019s asleep I often so downstairs in the kitchen and make food and play music on my speaker while I meal prep. It\u2019s apart of my routine through out the day that i really enjoy since I don\u2019t work till 2pm. \n\nBut yesterday my roommate downstairs texted our group chat and asked us to please stop playing music in the kitchen at any time of the day. She said it wakes her up almost every time and when she is a wake it\u2019s just very disruptive. My other roommate said sure but I said that\u2019s not really fair because she often plays music too in the kitchen. She told me it wasn\u2019t really fair that she had the shittiest room in the house and that if I wanted to switch with her so she wouldn\u2019t have to be woken up by it that would be fine. Of course I said no and said I was going to keep playing music because it\u2019s noon usually when I do it and it\u2019s ridiculous I have to step around her schedule. \n\nBoth my roommates are saying I\u2019m being an asshole and that it\u2019s the least I can do because I have the best room in the house because it\u2019s the most separate.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes.

AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my toddler with my 'childfree' sister for a few minutes, resulting in a trip to the emergency room? | I (18f) have a 2 year old daughter who lives with me and her father (18m), but spends two daytimes a week with my mom so that I can run errands (such as going to the doctors, doing the food shopping, cleaning the house, etc) and because my mom loves to spend time with my daughter. \n\nMy 27 year old sister was visiting my mom's house for the week from out of town. My sister and I have never really got on, when I got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks I force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). So, when I went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, I was shocked to find my sister there alone. I asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes. \n\nMy sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why I think this happened. I huffed because I was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. My sister rolled her eyes. I asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch TV until mom came back. My sister said 'absolutely not, I hate children and I don't feel comfortable being alone with her'. \n\nNow, I completely understood this and I think she was very clear in saying she didn't want to. I called mom on the doorstep and she said she was just leaving the store now, so she would be max five minutes. My sister rolled her eyes and said 'Fine, I'll take her', and she took the baby out of the stroller. I was in a rush and thought my sister would be able to cope for five minutes.

That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off.

I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot.

She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting.

One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do.

We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off.

She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I don\u2019t get my daughter in law Taco Bell for her birthday as she requested and instead got a traditional cake for the treat? | My daughter i law and I have a spotty relationship at best.

He said if I can\u2019t just bring the Taco Bell, please let him know and he\u2019d handle it. \n\nThe issue is, I\u2019m disgusted with the way she feeds her family.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"I taught the child to cut his fingernails with clippers.\"\"\"",

This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"I told the hospital front desk my son was seriously ill because he needed a doctor's attention.\"\"\"",

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"I pulled my friend from the top of the waterfall.\"\"\"",

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda.

My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d?

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes.

AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d?

I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using).

My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes.

AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d?

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes.

AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely.

I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him.

He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not watching my neighbor's kids for free? | Backstory: the people next door have four children ages 2, 4, 7 & 9.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d?

I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely.

So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d?

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

Overall their expenses have been pretty much the same.

It basically evened out in the end.\n\nBut one thing we said from the get-go is that college expenses are separate. Lola's mom was not in the picture and Kim's dad was barely in the picture. My husband & I did not expect either of them to help us out, so we individually saved for our daughters. I have roughly $25K saved up for Kim's college, James has about $28K for Lola's college.\n\nAbout a month ago, Kim's dad called me and told me he had enough money saved to cover some of Kim's college.

But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely.

I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to hang out with our new \"friends\" | My wife and I just bought an RV and took it out for the first time.

So whatever worked for this guy, cool.\n\nWe all had lunch together and then somehow we got talked into going out for fancy coffee with these people and we are sitting around at the coffee shop bullshitting and this guy started talking about how open he is that he's in recovery and about his religion and whatever and I asked him what the most difficult part of that all was for him and he gave me some weird answer about \"sins of the flesh.\" - Which is a term that he used a few times and he basically said he's celibate and not interested in dating he just wants to find a person to marry. This was one of the first red flags for me. \n\nThen he started telling me about his church. I'm not irreligious myself and I'm not against anyone else's.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For being really rude to an annoying coworker | I'm a student 20, been working at the same place for 4 years now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love.

The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns.

As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work.

This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine?

I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

While you have honored the agreement to pay her back, it is understandable to feel frustrated that she has not offered the money outright, especially since it appears to be a small fraction of her overall wealth. \n\nHaving a conversation about this could help clarify your feelings and potentially lead to a better understanding between you and your mother. It is important to approach the discussion with sensitivity, acknowledging her perspective while also expressing your own feelings about the situation.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine?

I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot.

She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reacting to my boyfriends snap story? | AITA for reacting to my boyfriend\u2019s snap story?\n\nMe and my boyfriend have been going through a rough patch the last few days because of me being overly clingy/paranoid so I\u2019m worried I\u2019m being a bit overemotional here.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"I talked on the phone while driving the school bus.\"\"\"",

I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus.

He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for reporting a fast food manager? | My husband and I frequent this fast food sandwich restaurant.

She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting my dad to get married the weekend before me? | I have always had a really good relationship with my dad.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns.

Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"I asked a little girl to come over and cuddle.\"\"\"",

As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using).

AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not extravagantly tipping a bartender who gave me a free drink? | So my friend works at a restaurant. I go there around closing time with another friend just to pick him up. My other friend asks him if he can give us some chicken tenders for free since they're really good at this place and they usually have extra. He's done this before a few times for my friend, but it's my first time. So we go in, and the waiter/bartender tells us the kitchen is closed. We go talk to our friend and he tells them he's gonna make it for us, so we sit down at the bar and get a beer each. Tenders come out (the bartender did bring them out, not my friend), we eat the tenders, everyone's happy. \n\nAs we're leaving, I offer to pay the whole tab, ie. Both beers we ordered. Dude hands me the machine and he charged us for the tenders, which were more expensive than the drinks, but fine. I give him 15% for bringing the stuff out. I know some people might say 20 is the standard but I'm from a small town in the Midwest, 10 is for average, 15 is for good here. But, considering the small order, I guess I could have given him 20%. \n\nAnyways, as we're leaving, my friend who works at this spot tells me that the dude told him I gave him a low tip when he gave us \"free drinks\", and basically that we shouldn't come back. At first I'm like yeah I wasn't thinking, I should have covered the cost of the beer or at least close to it.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

Thankfully, she puts sweet n low in it instead of sugar.\n\nHe took one sip and told her how sweet it tasted. He was worried about his diabetes, until she explained that she used a sugar substitute. I swear to you, he drank almost the whole pitcher. He fell in love with the tea. So he asked me to start making the stuff too. \n\nSo, I did. I got some tea bags and made some. So, after it was ready, he came and got himself a big glass. But he spit it out because I didn't put any sweetener in it. I hold him he had to put it in himself.\n\nSo he did, but e complained it wasn't as good like that. After a few days, every pitcher I made, I didn't put the sweetener right in the pitcher.

As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot.

She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money.

Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling.

However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for feeling betrayed by my son? | This will be a long one. \n\nMe and my ex husband divorced about sixteen years ago due to him cheating.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him.

So I said to him, \u201cDo you know what day my birthday is?\u201d He said he knows my birthday is on the 18th but he really wants to go on the trip.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"I tightened the lug nuts on her car.\"\"\"",

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting.

All five of the rest of the family think that we should get a second dog so that our dog will have a pack mate. It took time but I was finally able to extract from the husband that he doesn't want another dog because when the dog gets out he is anxious that she will get hit by a car and hurt the driver or passengers of the car. \n\nMy opinion is that his anxiety is affecting the family in a negative way and he should go to the doctor and try to deal with it. He thinks we should all respect him and not do things that make him anxious.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop.

We have a 6yo son and two cats. My mother\u2019s husband had had died a few year\u2019s back and mom doesn\u2019t drive and lived 2000 miles away from the nearest relative. She had nowhere to go and did not plan at all for her retirement. She lives off of a very small social security check per month and that is it so we invited her and her little dog to live with us.\n\nThe dog was old but it kept her company. When she came to live with us the dog would piss on everything. Naturally this upset my wife and I especially since my mom is like \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af anytime we bring it up. She\u2019d act like we were putting her out because her widdle precious doggie who could never ever do such a thing was being persecuted even though we saw the little shithead just for example, lifted his leg on a stack of records or a stack of laundry. Or he\u2019d cough up huge pile of barf and she\u2019d pretend not to see it. Because that widdle doggie was just way too precious to ever do such a thing!\n\nMom would take off on cruises with her sister and expect us to watch her little precious every few months for two weeks at a stretch. This went on for several months. It didn\u2019t make us happy and in fact started several fights. Eventually the dog died. It really was surprising that it lived as long as it did considering she rarely took him to the vet and refused to feed him dog food. I shit you not - this dog\u2019s daily diet consisted of ham or turkey human lunch meat and some cheddar cheese. We\u2019d feed that dog some real dog food and it would seem to be so happy getting some better nutrition but she would refuse to feed that kind of stuff to him. For months she avoided taking him to the vet because she knew that the vet would either want to do some costly procedures or put him down.

Never mind our thoughts or feelings or our goddamn lease for that matter which specifically says no dogs. My wife is apoplectic.  Mom knew it would cause strife and particularly piss her off. My wife and I have both told her many times we don\u2019t want a dog.

My mother\u2019s husband had had died a few year\u2019s back and mom doesn\u2019t drive and lived 2000 miles away from the nearest relative. She had nowhere to go and did not plan at all for her retirement. She lives off of a very small social security check per month and that is it so we invited her and her little dog to live with us.\n\nThe dog was old but it kept her company. When she came to live with us the dog would piss on everything. Naturally this upset my wife and I especially since my mom is like \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af anytime we bring it up. She\u2019d act like we were putting her out because her widdle precious doggie who could never ever do such a thing was being persecuted even though we saw the little shithead just for example, lifted his leg on a stack of records or a stack of laundry. Or he\u2019d cough up huge pile of barf and she\u2019d pretend not to see it. Because that widdle doggie was just way too precious to ever do such a thing!\n\nMom would take off on cruises with her sister and expect us to watch her little precious every few months for two weeks at a stretch. This went on for several months. It didn\u2019t make us happy and in fact started several fights. Eventually the dog died. It really was surprising that it lived as long as it did considering she rarely took him to the vet and refused to feed him dog food. I shit you not - this dog\u2019s daily diet consisted of ham or turkey human lunch meat and some cheddar cheese. We\u2019d feed that dog some real dog food and it would seem to be so happy getting some better nutrition but she would refuse to feed that kind of stuff to him. For months she avoided taking him to the vet because she knew that the vet would either want to do some costly procedures or put him down. To my mom, dogs can do no wrong, they are perfect little angels while people! Now people are the problem.\n\nSo mom has been away on another one of her two week excursions and she \u2018unexpectedly\u2019 fell in love with a new doggie and she\u2019s going to bring him home. She didn\u2019t consult with either me or my wife before doing so just announced it to us over text. Never mind our thoughts or feelings or our goddamn lease for that matter which specifically says no dogs. My wife is apoplectic.  Mom knew it would cause strife and particularly piss her off. My wife and I have both told her many times we don\u2019t want a dog. Again, I know I\u2019ve said it but I can\u2019t stress it enough - my mom has a long history of being super kooky when it comes to dogs.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes.

AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA If I stepped down from my friend's wedding 2 days prior? | A good friend of mine got engaged last July and asked me to be her maid of honor.

I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot.

She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work.

This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off.

I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling.

In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off.

I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me.

She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50.

She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for having an Almanac? | A bit of backstory.

She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 \"tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!\" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.\nIt started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife.

She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says \"I always thought you remembered this stuff...\" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my \"playbook\" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for calling cops on a begging gypsy with a limp child in her arms? | Today I was out and about in a Greek city and saw this gypsy begging outside a supermarket.

We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot.

She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"I failed the student because he was a different race.\"\"\"",

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life.

I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely.

I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him.

He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money.

She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"I banished my daughter to her room for twenty minutes for being rude.\"\"\"",

To my surprise, the necklace was a considerably more expensive item that they had presumably sent by mistake, when I looked at the site I saw they were selling it for over \u00a310,000+!\n\nI told my partner I planned on selling it and replacing it with the item I originally bought so I could recoup the money I spent and go on holiday with her and we could split the remainder and she got upset with me for this.\n\nI think the fact she\u2019s still receiving a \u00a35k necklace plus cash and a holiday for nothing from me demonstrates I\u2019m not TA but she thinks differently and we\u2019ve been arguing about it for days.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t sold the item yet, despite what the title originally suggested\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for allowing my niece to find out about her dad's criminal history? | My younger brother \"Jack\" has two daughters, who are nine and two. Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now.

It's annoying because I have to get contracts out fast or handle emails for the company. \n\nThe other day she asked me to go get her phone charger from the bedroom (15 ft away) while I was in the middle of sending out a contract. I told her \"I'm working\" to which she mocked me in the tone of \"oH, i'M wOrKiNg\". I just told her that I didn't feel like she respected my work hours, then put my headphones on so I wouldn't say anything I didn't mean. \n\nI just feel like she doesn't take my job seriously because it's a work from home job that's kind of unusual and fun. It pays the bills and I love it. That's all that should matter, right? Am I the asshole?",

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d?

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not refrigerating the chili my gf made? | This is the second time this has happened in the same exact context.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this.

I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for offering to pay a street performer $40 for him to stop butchering my favorite song? | I (18M) was strolling along the promenade with my sister (21F).

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns.

They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using).

I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my son\u2019s terrible school bus driver? | My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my GF's brother a christmas gift after he didn't invite me to dinner? | So my GF and I have been together for 7 years and we're planning to move in together next year (we're both 26).\n\nHis brother (32) recently moved in with his GF and never had a chance to have a proper housewarming dinner until now. We've talked multiple times about what to cook at said dinner, how I was gonna make his favourite cake (I'm a baker) and other general plans.\n\nLast night my girlfriend let me know that the housewarming dinner was going to be held on thursday but that he wished to invite only family and that he specifically asked that I didn't come because it was too much of a special moment.\n\nMy Girlfriend also let me know that he didn't buy me a gift this year (when questioned he said it was weird to give gifts to your sister's boyfriend). \n\nI bought him a very rare edition of his favourite book but honestly I don't feel like giving it to him now, what he said and did made me feel like after 7 years I'm still not considered family and that hurt.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to give him his Christmas gift?\n\nEDIT: My GF defended me and got into a fight with him, and she won't be attending the dinner \"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my sis out? | Our parents are controlling and verbally abusive. There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not going to my best friend and housemates hen party? | I live with my best friend (let\u2019s call her Stephanie) and her now fianc\u00e9 (I\u2019ll call him dave) , I pay rent for a room in the house they own together.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there).

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off.

I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me.

She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting.

One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for cutting contact with my vegetarian friend? | I know the title is misleading.

I had explained my reasons for not wanting to go vegetarian and I could tell he didn\u2019t think they were good enough reasons but I didn\u2019t think any of it. It was my own choice anyway and I feel it would be a wrong reason to change my diet if it was only to please my friend and not because it was rooted in some personal morality or ideals. \n\nWe had decided we just shouldn\u2019t talk about the subject anymore, because we would always get into arguments about it. Not about wether or not he should be vegetarian, of course, I supported him and admired him for being so passionate about a cause that does more good than harm anyway.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d?

One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him. I'm very proud of how hard he's worked.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my SO I won\u2019t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don\u2019t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he\u2019d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I\u2019m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)\n\nMy SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don\u2019t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don\u2019t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. \n\nI\u2019ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can\u2019t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I\u2019m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won\u2019t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn\u2019t willing to help with his bills anymore. \n\nI feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I\u2019m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn\u2019t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I\u2019m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don\u2019t want to be paying bills that don\u2019t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn\u2019t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn\u2019t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get paid until tomorrow\u201d and is at work, etc. \n\nAm I being too harsh right now saying \u201cI\u2019m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself\u201d? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he\u2019s using me for money that I shouldn\u2019t be spending at this rate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control.

The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he\u2019s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. \n\nTwo weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would \u201ctry his best\u201d. \n\nThat afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said \u201cif you\u2019re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.\u201d\n\nAfter that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. \n\nI called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would \u201clook into it.\u201d After a couple more days, he hadn\u2019t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that \u201cnobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he\u2019s the best one at the school\u201d (Which I sincerely doubt). \n\nI mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is \u201cthe nicest guy you\u2019ll ever meet\u201c and that her children say my son is \u201cextremely disruptive\u201d on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn\u2019t be riding the bus.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50.

There was an incident that caused my 20 yo sister to lash out at them due to something offensive they said to her. My husband and I told her to come live with us. We have a 2 year old and I\u2019m pregnant, so I told her I\u2019d need her help with our 2 year old. She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA I cancelled on a friend for a date | I met and dated this girl, Agatha, for a month, over a year ago.

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes. They are furious that I allowed my niece to find out that information from someone besides them and for disclosing something they believe should be private. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again. Part of the reason I thought it was okay to mention it to my kids is that my brother has repeatedly told me that he speaks about his addiction regularly with his kids and that he wants them to have a clear picture of what addiction can do to your life. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding on my part of what those conversations looked like, but I thought that his kids knew. I definitely didn't say anything about it in order to shame him.

She said she understood.\n\nMy husband and I work full time, so she\u2019d watch her from around 9-6 except weekends when one or both of us were off. She\u2019d feed, bathe, change her diapers, get her down for a nap, play with her, etc. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot. My job was hiring seasonal employees and she got a job there but only about 6 hours a month since she was temporary. It was her first job interview, so I took her to buy interview clothes. She spent around $50 which I thought was a deal and figured she\u2019d make it back quickly. \n\nI told her no eating in her room (though admittedly the first week I sort of relaxed on it and let her) or accepting money from our parents. She came with money and her clothes, so I figured that would be enough until she got a job. (We live in southern CA.) We didn\u2019t ask her for rent money since our rent is virtually free through the military. We went grocery shopping and she gave us $100 for the grocery bill. This happened twice, for a total of $200. Everything was fine, but she\u2019d hang out in her room most of the time instead of with us when she wasn\u2019t babysitting. The first month, our electric bill went up $50. Granted, my husband or I would occasionally accidentally leave the tv on or a lamp or two on in the living area and have a few Scentsy warmers plugged in all night but that shouldn\u2019t cause a $50 hike. This got my husband and I angry because she was costing us money. She\u2019s very introverted, but still. \n\nShe wouldn\u2019t come out often, just to use the bathroom or eat, then go back. One day I went in and found a trash bag of wrappers, empty shopping bags and dried apple cores along with a couple empty cans of soda. This pissed me off beyond belief because I told her to not eat in her room, much less have a garbage bag in it. She said she did it because my husband and I (mostly him) has been getting into her food (true) and eating it all up from her and since we weren\u2019t home most days, she had to fend for herself for meals and because I griped at her for eating my Pringles, she knew she couldn\u2019t eat our food though she felt like he welcomes himself to hers and had to hide her food. She said I\u2019d eaten a can of her soup and my husband had eaten her cinnamon apple donut holes and half her jar of applesauce before she got to eat any of it. I found out she\u2019d been accepting money for groceries from our parents, allegedly with the promise of paying them back once she got enough hours because she was afraid she\u2019d run out of money. Though I have no proof, I\u2019m calling BS.\n\nMy husband and I talked to them and said she was no longer welcome, and now she is back with them.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting to move out while my mom needs me | I(22F) want to move out since I hate living with my mom(72F).\n\nWhile obviously I am old enough to move out and have the means, here are the reasons I might be the asshole if I do. She had a stem cell transplant 1.5 months ago and lost 6 pounds and some strength, but she is recovering well. She has me buy the groceries, clean the house, and take her to appointments. Just this morning, I woke up to her texts telling me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes and clean the yard. Daily, I walk the dog, clean her bathroom, and take her for a walk. I get annoyed because sometimes I will be studying and she will have me go out immediately for food because she wants it right now. She does not want me to stay overnight anywhere else because \"what is something happens to her in the night?\" The only sickness she has is cancer, which has gone in remission. She also states that I would be abandoning her by moving out because I don't need to move out and who would take care of her?\n\nI want to move out because I have never moved out and I finally want independence. I want to be able to stay over at a friend's place and come and go as I please. Sometimes it'll be 8 or 9PM and I want to get something at the store but she won't let me leave because she wants to go to bed. It is also hard to live with my mom. If I try to talk to her about my feelings when she does something I think is uncalled for, she says \"I don't feel well. Why do you only care about your feelings, what about mine? You're being selfish.\" When she gets really frustrated with me trying to talk to her, she'll yell \"fuck you\" or \"I didn't raise you to be this selfish and cruel.\" I  feel like I can't share freely and will be judged and admonished. I honestly think she would throw me out if she knew I wasn't a virgin and am on birth control. I also think she can be more independent than she is but having me is convenient. Her doctors encourage her to get out of the house and walk around but she spends a lot of time in bed, but she has driven herself places and gone grocery shopping before. Additionally, i believe she is emotionally manipulative. She has done things that have crossed the line in the past that I felt bad for being mad about until other people pointed out that I should be mad and she is manipulating me into feeling bad for her.\n\nMy friends and I think she has some mental issues but she refuses to see a therapist and would not be receptive to family counseling. She is a single mom and I believe that her having 100% control and decision-making power has made her into a slight narcissist parent. I am seeing a place on Saturday and my friends are encouraging me to do this. Also, I am graduating in December and before this, I commuted to school\n\nAITA for wanting to move out in 1 month?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my parents to stop streaming Netflix? | So, I pay rent at home, 155 a week plus extra for vet bills as well as helping out with the animals on the property. I'm a third year University student whose courses for the semester have been moved to online only which would be okay if I lived in town where there was stable reception. So here lies the problem...\n\nI have to catch up on a lot of lectures that my professors have only just uploaded before Monday this coming week, which is fine, easy enough work. However, my parents LOVE watching Netflix because freeview is \"awful\" (it's just free tv so has news, drama shows, cartoons, music, etc) so they watch Netflix 24/7 essentially when the weather outside is grey which it has been for the past 3 days. This makes it extremely difficult to watch my lectures as they buff every 30 seconds even after having been paused for 10 minutes. I have asked my parents if they could stop streaming while I study so that I can finish my work but they refuse saying that \"It can't be /that/ important. Just be patient for fuck sake\" stuff like that. This makes me feel like a real ass and bad for even asking let alone studying.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for asking them to stop streaming so I can study?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"I sold my run down car online photoshopping it to look brand-new online\"\"\"",
