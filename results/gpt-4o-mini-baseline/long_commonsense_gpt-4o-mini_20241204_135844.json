Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy. It means a lot to me.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I returned a yard sale sign to the address it advertises | I live at the end of a very busy intersection & someone put a sign in my devil strip to advertise their yard sale.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.  My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.   I recently broke down and told them and said it wasn't fair that I was only 21 and my dad was already almost 84.  I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.  My dad didn't say anything but I could tell he was pissed.  My sister has expressed similar feelings.  I feel robbed of 30 years with my parents.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for going out in a pair of shorts? | So I (23M) am covered in burn scars over every inch of my body with the exception of my face, neck and back. For context, my house went on fire when I was 10 and I was lucky to survive. It was obviously traumatising and after a long time of hating my body, I became an alcoholic in my teens to cope.

On full display was my prosthetic and my badly scarred left leg. I should  also note I received a skin graft on that leg, so some of the skin is more visible and scarred than other portions.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I decided to take a little walk before going to the store and I cut through a park. There isn\u2019t much people around but there\u2019s a few out. I got a couple of stares but that\u2019s normal and I got to the store. I browsed for the stuff I needed like normal and when I got to checkout, there was a huge queue.

That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower?

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us.

She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it.

Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom.

She ultimately said \u201cwe will take it one kid at a time,\u201d but she knows she is very persuasive and typically will get her way when it comes to these types of things. \r\n\r\nFast forward to today. We have a three year old daughter and a 4 month old daughter (we both secretly were hoping for another girl so they could be sisters). Dealing with the newborn phase again reminds me of the effort, exhaustion, stupid marital fights, and financial burden that comes with having a baby.\r\n\r\nIn more recent conversations (when she was pregnant with our second) I told my wife that I would be willing to have three kids, because in theory it would be fun to have a bigger family. However after these last four months, I\u2019ve realized that I love my girls and our family as is. I am perfectly happy with two kids and do not want another. \r\n\r\nAfter telling my wife this, she became extremely upset because she wants AT LEAST 3 and claimed I was an asshole because I had previously loosely agreed to having a third.\r\n\r\nAITA for previously telling my wife I\u2019d like to have 3 kids and now saying I only want 2?",

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.  My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.

She got tastefully-sized implants. They\u2019re super round and look like two tennis balls glued to her chest. Plus, she doesn\u2019t hesitate to show them off.

This must have been the first time. I was already thinking about how perky and gravity-defying her breasts were since I saw her roll up in that outfit, but it was in the back of my mind.

Which girl wouldn\u2019t want gravity-defying breasts that don\u2019t need heavy duty sports bras to restrain them during strenuous exercise? Plus, Annie usually doesn\u2019t take banter too seriously. \r\n\r\n\r\nBack to the story we go. Annie glared at me and said \u201cexcuse me?\u201d, and not in a lighthearted tone. I told her to please excuse my potty mouth because I really didn\u2019t mean to offend her if I did. She asked me if it felt awesome to say such a childish thing about her boobs.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower?

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

She's working as much as she can to pay her bills but because shes a student and also doing her required interning she can't work much more. She doesnt ever ask me for money to help her right now because she wants me to save up.\r\n\r\nShe doesn't have a family like mine so she doesn't understand, my family is close and I really want to take care of them. She says that I'm supposed to be worrying about my own future right now. She says that she doesn't understand because my mom recently received about ~100k for a settlement and bought a house and a new car and I shouldn't be worrying about helping when they seem fine.\r\n\r\nShe is angry that I dont take my life seriously, I've been trying to get my real estate license for a few months now but cant find the time to study because of how demanding my family is, they get really angry/sad when I'm not around for family events and I understand why, we're a close family. I get where shes coming from but I cant drop my family. I told her all of this and she got angry saying that shes not asking me to abandon my family, she just wants to make sure we have a solid foundation before we worry about helping my family. And I cant build a future if I'm always with them.\r\n\r\nShe expects me to start saving up money for a downpayment on a house while she finishes and gets her degree and can start helping as well but I keep telling her my family needs me first. \r\n\r\nWe had a particularly heated fight, the worst we've ever had last night and she said she feels like I'll never care enough about my future and I'm supposed to be building one for myself and her and she can't be with someone like that. She said if I really feel like helping my family comes before my own future than that is my choice but she's going to have no choice but to worry about herself from now on and plan a future where shes her only priority because I make it sound like I don't want to be part of it. \r\n\r\nShes stopped mentioning anything about it and is now talking about saving up for a one bedroom apartment and a car for herself (she lives in a basement). She seems so sad but I cant help but feel like shes wrong for even asking me to not help my family. \r\n\r\nI dont know if I'm being an asshole or not for telling her that my family will always come first. \r\n\r\nAITA for telling her my family and their needs have to come before her and our future together?",

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind.

She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone.

He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

I don't really want to \"convert her\" or anything like that and we've already agreed to just let our kids choose whatever they want.\r\n\r\nAnyways, we're visiting my grandparents in India and I wanted to go around and see some famous temples. I took her to a few, but there's on major temple left. I don't want to specify which one for privacy reasons but from the way I'm describing it I don't think it'll be too hard to figure out which one. Anyways, this temple only allows Orthodox Hindus entry. I've always wanted to visit it.\r\n\r\nAn argument started between me and her because she says that she wanted to go too. I explained to her that this wasn't possible because she was not a Hindu. She said she could \"pretend\" to be a Hindu for a short while but I told her I would not be comfortable with that as it is against the temple's rules. The place is meant for spiritual connection and she just wants to see the architecture. She got pretty mad and went on a rant about religion before \"giving in\" and saying that if she couldn't go I shouldn't either.\r\n\r\nI think this is ridiculous. I've always wanted to go to this temple and I'm allowed entry. She just wants to \"admire the architecture\", which is fine for most temples, and she's gone to plenty with me already, but for a temple which explicitly bars her from going she should follow the rules. As for her argument she's accused me of being bigoted and intolerant for supporting a temple which does not allow entry to non Hindus. I don't find anything wrong with this as it's explicitly a Hindu place of worship, but that's just my opinion\r\n\r\nWIBTA if I went without her?",

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out.

And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower?

He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3.

I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation.

Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.  My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.   I recently broke down and told them and said it wasn't fair that I was only 21 and my dad was already almost 84.  I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.  My dad didn't say anything but I could tell he was pissed.  My sister has expressed similar feelings.  I feel robbed of 30 years with my parents.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for choosing to rent an affordable house instead of letting my friend rent it? | I am moving out of my apartment and renting a small house.

I asked my friend to come with me to tour the place and that led to a heated discussion.\r\n\r\nShe is married, living with her husband, and they qualified for subsidized housing. However, when it came time for them to re-qualify, it turns out that they just barely make over the income limit due to both of them getting raises, but they are literally a couple hundred dollars over. Not enough to afford an actual apartment. \r\n\r\nWhen I showed her the pictures of the house that I was going to tour and the price, she asked if I could forgo the house and get an apartment since I make way more than their combined income (which is true) and since I didn't need as much space (I'm single). She said without the house that I am looking at, they will have to take out loans to afford an actual apartment. I said no because I have been putting in all this work to find the house, and while I do make more money than them on paper, in reality, I have other expenses that sop up that extra money (student loans, auto loan, savings goals etc).

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge.

He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3.

I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

While it's understandable to feel exhausted by someone not taking advice seriously, the way the person communicated their feelings was dismissive and ultimately hurtful. Instead of providing support and understanding, they made their girlfriend feel inadequate and defensive, which led to her emotional breakdown.\n\nIt's important to recognize that people with ADHD may struggle with motivation and organization, and they may need more patience and encouragement rather than frustration. The person could have approached the situation with more empathy and offered to help her find resources or strategies that might work for her, rather than shutting down the conversation about advice altogether.

It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge.

He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening.

The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge.

Lie about your work all you want, I don't care, but I am done with you repeatedly justifying your antisocial behaviour by lying when it involves me.\r\n\r\nThe work part relates to her lying to my parents about getting a job, which I witness consistently and hold my tongue on. When she got this message, she went to Mum and Dad and they lost their shit at me. Mum told me if I ever pull such a 'threatening stunt' again, I am to pack my shit and leave immediately. I thought I was 100% in the right, but for the first time my father is wholeheartedly siding with the rest of the family which makes me doubt myself.\r\n\r\nSo Reddit, in sending that message, am I the asshole here? How should I have handled it?",

She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

She is on medication for her anxiety, and she does work through her issues slowly, but when one thing is resolved it seems like another just pops up. \r\n\r\nSome things she has anxiety about that affect me include:\r\n\r\n* anxiety surrounding food: she doesn't like to eat in front of me (she had ednos in the past and now has some left over anxiety) so if I eat before I get home and don't stop to tell her, she probably won't eat a full meal and will just snack. \r\n* she clams up when we go to my parent's house and food is involved: my parents will always cook for me if I go home to visit them with her, but she is vegetarian and they don't cook vegetarian. this links back to the first point, as this means she won't eat anything at my parent's house if I eat there. \r\n* she gets upset if I don't tell her I'm going out: sometimes I go for a beer with my friends for a few hours after work without telling her, and she says she's worried. I think this is really dramatic. \r\n* she gets anxious when I don't tell her the full details of plans: we have the same friend group but I often make the plans because she gets nervous asserting herself, and she gets anxious if I don't tell her every little detail. \r\n\r\nShe argues that it would be 'easy' for me to accomodate these changes. She argues with the first two points that if I just texted her I was gonna eat before I got home, she could sort herself out.

I think this is dumb, because I don't know when I'm going to be hungry, and it's not my fault my parents won't cook vegetarian. \r\n\r\nI find her last two points just controlling. I don't get why she has to know everything. She says that she doesn't get why it matters, because it would make literally no difference to me for me to tell her I was going out.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

While the parent's intentions may have been to protect or understand their daughter better, the act of listening in on an intimate discussion without her knowledge is a breach of privacy. This understandably upset the daughter, leading to her anger and withdrawal. Trust is crucial in parent-child relationships, and this incident could damage that trust.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

My family has a dog who\u2019s six months old and pretty small, think cocker spaniel. He\u2019s a puppy, so he\u2019s jumpy, but whenever we meet people we make sure we can hold him back and he has gotten much better at greeting people. My neighbor, who lives downstairs, has two cats. Of course, whenever the pup meets her he smells the cats and gets all jumpy. We restrain him and apologize every time, usually he doesn\u2019t even jump on her because we grab him. We\u2019re always extremely apologetic about his behavior to her, and make it known that she can tell us if his barking gets too loud. \r\n\r\nToday I was taking him out for a walk as my designated teen duties (I\u2019m 15) and we encounter the neighbor in the tiny lobby space. It\u2019s less than 5x5, so not even much space for two. Of course the dog goes crazy, and I grab him to make sure he doesn\u2019t jump. This is where my neighbor, who\u2019s never owned a dog in her life, decides to teach me how to handle the pup. \r\n\r\nShe grabs him, already setting me on edge, and tries to sit him down on the ground. The pup, thinking it\u2019s time to play with this new person, only jumps up more.

I\u2019m polite, laughing and saying how jumpy he is and sort of agreeing with her. \r\n\r\nI try and leave, saying he needs his walk, but apparently I haven\u2019t gotten her message. She just keeps going on and making these passive aggressive little comments about the dog all while pretty much holding him down.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license.

She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it.

He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned.

And I would really want to donate, but I am legitimately horrified at the thought.\r\n\r\nBackstory: When I was 18, one of those blood-donation vans came to my high school. It was the first time I had ever been old enough to donate, so myself and a friend went together. I had my blood typed a few years earlier and I knew I was AB negative. \r\n\r\nDon't know if any of you have been in one of those vans, but they sit you in these reclining chairs, insert the withdrawing needle, and you're supposed to relax (and squeeze one of those cush balls) for a few minutes until they collect enough blood. And if you tap out before they collect enough, they actually have to throw out any blood they collected from you, they can't just keep it.\r\n\r\nSo a few minutes into getting it drawn, I'm starting to feel horrible. The nurse couldn't get it in the vein for a few tries, so my arm hurts, I'm weak, my brain is foggy and I'm starting to hear a rushing sound in my ears. Then all the warmth started to drain from my body. I wanted to maybe tell a nurse, but I knew if I wimped out early, all my blood would be wasted. \r\n\r\nI look over at my friend, and she immediately starts freaking out, apparently because I'm pale as hell and my eyes glazed over. And the last thing I remember is getting this surge of fear and ripping out the needle. Blood everywhere, and I passed the fuck out.\r\n\r\nThat was a few years ago, and ever since then I've been terrified of donating blood, and needles, and doctors. If I see blood I will legitimately feel like I'm going to pass out again. \r\n\r\nI recently told this story to a few friends, and one of them (a nurse) said that even if I had one bad experience, I need to get over it because my blood type is so rare. \r\n\r\nShe's been pretty insistent about it, even pointing out that there's a collection center not too far from my work.\r\n\r\nI'm conflicted. On the one hand, she's a medical professional, and seems really upset that I'm 'wasting' my blood. And it's not like I have a real phobia or something, it just freaks me out. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it REALLY freaks me out. So should I just suck it up and donate?\"\"\"",

And I would really want to donate, but I am legitimately horrified at the thought.\r\n\r\nBackstory: When I was 18, one of those blood-donation vans came to my high school. It was the first time I had ever been old enough to donate, so myself and a friend went together. I had my blood typed a few years earlier and I knew I was AB negative. \r\n\r\nDon't know if any of you have been in one of those vans, but they sit you in these reclining chairs, insert the withdrawing needle, and you're supposed to relax (and squeeze one of those cush balls) for a few minutes until they collect enough blood. And if you tap out before they collect enough, they actually have to throw out any blood they collected from you, they can't just keep it.\r\n\r\nSo a few minutes into getting it drawn, I'm starting to feel horrible. The nurse couldn't get it in the vein for a few tries, so my arm hurts, I'm weak, my brain is foggy and I'm starting to hear a rushing sound in my ears. Then all the warmth started to drain from my body. I wanted to maybe tell a nurse, but I knew if I wimped out early, all my blood would be wasted. \r\n\r\nI look over at my friend, and she immediately starts freaking out, apparently because I'm pale as hell and my eyes glazed over. And the last thing I remember is getting this surge of fear and ripping out the needle. Blood everywhere, and I passed the fuck out.\r\n\r\nThat was a few years ago, and ever since then I've been terrified of donating blood, and needles, and doctors. If I see blood I will legitimately feel like I'm going to pass out again. \r\n\r\nI recently told this story to a few friends, and one of them (a nurse) said that even if I had one bad experience, I need to get over it because my blood type is so rare. \r\n\r\nShe's been pretty insistent about it, even pointing out that there's a collection center not too far from my work.\r\n\r\nI'm conflicted. On the one hand, she's a medical professional, and seems really upset that I'm 'wasting' my blood. And it's not like I have a real phobia or something, it just freaks me out. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it REALLY freaks me out. So should I just suck it up and donate?",

I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far.

She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

This is my first job, so I'm trying to remain as professional as possible (even though I probably won't include this on any resume in the future).\r\n\r\nI'm considering speaking with management and letting them know that I will not be able to work that many hours because I am a full time student with a part time job. If they can't accommodate my hours that I asked for, then I will have to leave and focus on school full time before next week.\r\n\r\nHow should I go about this?

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge.

He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3.

Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

I feel robbed of 30 years with my parents.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to help out my dad and his wife? | Throw away account for reasons.\r\n\r\nSome background information:\r\n\r\nAbout 6 years ago, my dad had an affair with another woman which ultimately led to my parents separation. He impregnated his mistress, and eventually got married. Our relationship has been rocky ever since.\r\n\r\nMy dad seems to be the primary taker of his child (now 4 y/o) due to her mother working long hours nearly everyday. Although I have a rocky relationship with my dad, I still spend time with my younger half sister and treat her no different as any of my other siblings. Recently, my dad reached out to me in need of help to watch younger half sister while he goes on vacation for 3 weeks. Unfortunately, the time he's leaving falls around the time of my busiest school quarter, and then Spring break- which puts me in a situation where I'd have to sacrifice pretty much all of my spare time to watch half sister. I usually wouldn't mind, however, my dad has failed to ask half sisters mom to sacrifice any of her time in order to take care of her own child. She refuses to take time off work, or even work fewer hours, and insists I take their child for nearly 13 hours each day in order for her to get sleep and feel energized for work.

He impregnated his mistress, and eventually got married. Our relationship has been rocky ever since.\r\n\r\nMy dad seems to be the primary taker of his child (now 4 y/o) due to her mother working long hours nearly everyday. Although I have a rocky relationship with my dad, I still spend time with my younger half sister and treat her no different as any of my other siblings. Recently, my dad reached out to me in need of help to watch younger half sister while he goes on vacation for 3 weeks. Unfortunately, the time he's leaving falls around the time of my busiest school quarter, and then Spring break- which puts me in a situation where I'd have to sacrifice pretty much all of my spare time to watch half sister. I usually wouldn't mind, however, my dad has failed to ask half sisters mom to sacrifice any of her time in order to take care of her own child. She refuses to take time off work, or even work fewer hours, and insists I take their child for nearly 13 hours each day in order for her to get sleep and feel energized for work.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.   I recently broke down and told them and said it wasn't fair that I was only 21 and my dad was already almost 84.  I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.  My dad didn't say anything but I could tell he was pissed.  My sister has expressed similar feelings.

We've never been super close by any stretch of the imagination, but we've certainly been in the same friendship group. To be honest I've always found her...a lot. She's the type of person who will post on Facebook about feeling miserable and then say she doesn't want to talk about it when people ask. \r\n\r\nAnyway, about six months ago Mia and I discovered that we both suffer from the same mental health condition. I won't get specific so as not to reveal too many identifying details, but it's a pretty shitty condition which comes with a whole host of pretty intense symptoms. I went through hell with it in years past, but am dealing much better now. I believed she was too, and told her if she did ever wanna talk with someone who knew she could talk to me. She told me the same. \r\n\r\nHonestly, I regret telling her this. It feels like every day she's calling me with some new problem, usually crying on the phone for up to an hour. I get that our condition can make tiny things seem like catastrophes but the things she calls me and cries about are varied and endless. Anything from a fight with her parents, with whom she has a horrible relationship, to the supermarket having no milk left so she can't have any tea tonight. I feel like this would take a lot of energy and be draining even for a neurotypical person. With my condition, it's downright exhausting. Especially given she more often than not ghosts me if I try to talk to her about my own issues bc she doesn't have the energy to help me out that day. \r\n\r\nSo here's my situation. I've tried talking to Mia about maybe switching therapists/getting more therapy (I've used her current therapist myself in the past and honestly he's not great), but she insists this is working for her. She doesn't like to take medication, which I believe would help, but okay that's her decision. Point is, she doesn't really seem to be making any proactive steps to improve and I don't know if I can handle her at full-tilt any more. The issue is I'm kinda the only person apart from her therapist she can really talk to about mental health things. None of our other friends have the condition so, while sympathetic, can only help so much. As I mentioned she has a shitty relationship with her family and can't really talk to them about it. If I cut her off, I'm essentially taking away her one outlet in order to save my own mental health. I just feel like that's disgustingly selfish, and idk if it's worth it.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge.

I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3.

I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.  My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.

It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him.

Now, from time to time, she complains about there not being any shiny Pok\u00e9mon in the wild, which I take offense to because as an avid player of the original games, I know how hard it is to get a shiny Pok\u00e9mon; however, Go players get all these stupid community events where everyone can get a shiny Pok\u00e9mon, eliminating the challenge the original games had where you never really knew if a Pok\u00e9mon you encountered was shiny until you knew. Anyways, AITA? Please let me know, I\u2019m just trying to help my mom put away this child\u2019s game.",

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.  My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.

I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.

It was a conflicting thought, I believed that whatever you give should not have a limit and should be always appreciated as long as you don't give something insulting like a 25 cent coin.

Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower?

I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation.

I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone.

He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry.

If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her.

I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower?

Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license.

She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.  My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.   I recently broke down and told them and said it wasn't fair that I was only 21 and my dad was already almost 84.  I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.  My dad didn't say anything but I could tell he was pissed.  My sister has expressed similar feelings.

They've known each other since kindergarten so maybe that'd explain the fact that they're so attached to one another.\r\n\r\nHowever... And excuse me if I'm being offensive, but literally everyone who meets Matt is convinced he's gay. When I first met him, I was almost sure of it. I went to art school, something like 90% of my male friends were gay so I'd think I have a pretty good gaydar. My best (gay) friend even said \"yup, that guy likes dick\" as soon as he saw Matt.\r\n\r\nMatt laughs that stuff off though, as does my boyfriend. Normally I'd take his word for it, but his behavior says otherwise. I think Matt has a thing for my boyfriend.\r\n\r\nFor example... Last year, Matt had a girlfriend of 5 months. They broke up specifically because Matt wanted to go vacationing *only* with my boyfriend, that is his best friend, not his girlfriend. And that's something they regularly do together: take trips completely alone, without other friends or partners.\r\n\r\nIt also seems like Matt feels entitled to spending more time with my boyfriend than anyone else. He easily gets jealous if my boyfriend cancels their plans to hang out with me and my friends.\r\n\r\nTo top it all off, my boyfriend did admit Matt once tried to make out with him, then kiss his neck back in college. They were drunk though, and my boyfriend doesn't think much of it.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox!

I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done.

My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes.

Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.  My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.

I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.

She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower?

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

My parents got divorced when I was really young, around 3 or so, after the divorce, my mom got remarried and didn\u2019t really give two shits about my father. My dad died when I was 11, and I\u2019ve been getting survivor benefits since then.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license.

She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower?

Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation.

My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.   I recently broke down and told them and said it wasn't fair that I was only 21 and my dad was already almost 84.  I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.

I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far.

She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry.

I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

(where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.   I recently broke down and told them and said it wasn't fair that I was only 21 and my dad was already almost 84.  I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.  My dad didn't say anything but I could tell he was pissed.  My sister has expressed similar feelings.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table.

She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge.

Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out.

She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower?

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him.

This particular incident got brought up because we went to family therapy - not because we're having problems or arguing or anything but because we want to take our marriage to the next level.\r\n\r\nI don't quite have an aversion or a phobia of blood but when I see traumatic and/or gruesome things happen then I tend to get really nauseous and/or pass out. A tame example that might seem silly is that when we were watching Endgame last year I momentarily fainted when >!Thor beheaded Thanos!<. I say momentarily because it only lasted for a couple seconds and then I was awake.Another time I was watching a basketball game and somebody broke their leg to a point where the tibia was sticking out of the skin and I threw up my entire life savings. As far as I know (and my GP agrees with me) this is not indicative of any bigger health problems and its not worth taking medication for, since it happens so infrequently.\r\n\r\nI was afraid of this happening when my wife was due to give birth and she told me that I should just suck it up - truth be told I wasn't very thrilled with hearing that because I felt like she was dismissing my legitimate concerns and making me out to be a sissy. But eventually I decided that I would try not to worry about what could happen and that I'd cross that bridge if (when) we got there. \r\n\r\nNarrator: It did happen.\r\n\r\nI won't get into the gruesome details but I ended up puking, thankfully the nurses had the presence of mind to have buckets just for this purpose but I still got some on my clothes. True to form, I did momentarily faint again and came to slumped over in a chair in the corner of the room surrounded by concerned nurses. At this point I was taking a lot of attention from my wife and I was pretty sure that if I stayed in the room it'd happen again.

            "input": "AITA for leaving the room while my wife was giving birth? | Just to be clear this happened a few years ago, and me and my wife are now parents to a beautiful, healthy girl. This particular incident got brought up because we went to family therapy - not because we're having problems or arguing or anything but because we want to take our marriage to the next level.\r\n\r\nI don't quite have an aversion or a phobia of blood but when I see traumatic and/or gruesome things happen then I tend to get really nauseous and/or pass out. A tame example that might seem silly is that when we were watching Endgame last year I momentarily fainted when >!Thor beheaded Thanos!<. I say momentarily because it only lasted for a couple seconds and then I was awake.Another time I was watching a basketball game and somebody broke their leg to a point where the tibia was sticking out of the skin and I threw up my entire life savings. As far as I know (and my GP agrees with me) this is not indicative of any bigger health problems and its not worth taking medication for, since it happens so infrequently.\r\n\r\nI was afraid of this happening when my wife was due to give birth and she told me that I should just suck it up - truth be told I wasn't very thrilled with hearing that because I felt like she was dismissing my legitimate concerns and making me out to be a sissy. But eventually I decided that I would try not to worry about what could happen and that I'd cross that bridge if (when) we got there. \r\n\r\nNarrator: It did happen.\r\n\r\nI won't get into the gruesome details but I ended up puking, thankfully the nurses had the presence of mind to have buckets just for this purpose but I still got some on my clothes. True to form, I did momentarily faint again and came to slumped over in a chair in the corner of the room surrounded by concerned nurses. At this point I was taking a lot of attention from my wife and I was pretty sure that if I stayed in the room it'd happen again. Thus I made the decision that I had to leave and get myself cleaned up.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4.

They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out.

The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom.

My aunt said \"I guess you don't care about us then\" and out the phone down.\r\n\r\nYesterday and today they've both messaged me asking if can lend them another tenner for food, cigarettes, and nappies again. I've said no again because I a) cannot afford it and b) I'm not comfortable lending money to people I barely know. My cousin has said I clearly don't have any family values, and family can't be important to me if I won't help them out.\r\n\r\nSo reddit, AITA here?",

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.  My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.

My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.   I recently broke down and told them and said it wasn't fair that I was only 21 and my dad was already almost 84.  I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it.

Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate.

Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities.

Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower?

He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

He's clearly cheated which is confirmed by the multiple texts to other girls. He showed Anna and then me. I took a look, and didn't like what I saw. I decided to also tell my husband and he flat out said ''Don't bother me with this shit I have more important things to do'' (which to his credit, is true. He works close to 80 hours a week.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge.

He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3.

Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't.

But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7.

I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower?

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her.

They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower?

I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants.

So I replied and said \"Are you serious? C is the least helpful person I know. He is lazy, manipulative,  disrespectful, argumentative, doesn't help you do anything - not even bring in the groceries and you're disabled - or pay his way. He is the least deserving person you know to go with you! You could have picked anyone else!\".\r\n\r\nL had actually won the competition (not sure how exactly it works) - but after my comment was made, less than 20  minutes later, L called me, crying and yelling saying that the cinema had deleted their comment and redrawn prizes saying that there was a \"mistake\" and the winner was actually (random girl). L thinks I'm an absolute asshole for doing what I did and that I have no idea how much this would have meant to L and C and how dare I hate C for \"no good reason\". I told her I hate C because of all of the above reasons and she told me that she \"never said that\" and that C is an amazing person.  L claims she's also had a couple of messages from friends asking if she's in an unsafe relationship and if she needs to be 'rescued' from C - which was, in L's words \"completely humiliating\".\r\n\r\nSo AITA? Or is this just a blessing in disguise if other people are now also keeping an eye on L's situation? They wouldn't be offering to 'rescue' her if they thought everything was fine right?  \r\n\r\n\r\nEdit due to a word that would have gotten the post removed",

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.  My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.

I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.

After some picking and choosing I eventually ended up agreeing to let this guy we'll call John(Fake name) be my roommate.\r\n\r\nNow all went well between John and me, we were certainly not best friends as we were too different for that. But regardless of this we got along just fine, he pays on time and he discusses important crap impacting both of us before doing it which is important if you ever had roommates. That is until he decided to get a dog, without a warning, asking me or even informing me, suddenly I enter my house and I am greeted by the high pitched barks of a tiny dog and a smiling John playing with said dog.\r\n\r\nSo obviously I ask him why there is a dog in the living room and John informs me he bought a dog and so forth, well as you might imagine shit blew up at that point, this is something you discuss not something you just do. But to make a long story short I felt bad about making him take the dog back so I told him, he could keep it if he agreed to some basic rules. 1: I don't want the dog sitting on my furniture.(I own 90% of the furniture) 2: If he breaks or ruins anything you will replace it, not cover it up, not try to fix it, Replace it. 3: You will be the only person taking care of this dog, I will do absolutely nothing. 4: He is not allowed in my bedroom or attached Bathroom. 5: You do the vacuuming(Having had dogs most of my life until now, I know how much more vacuuming will have to be done with a dog around)\r\n\r\nWell we are now 3 months later and John is not enjoying this new arrangement, he calls me to please feed his dog, I say no. He calls me to please walk his dog because he is working late, No Sir. The dog decided to rip a hole in my couch, well that was an expensive one, wasn't it John? Will you do the vacuuming just once? No John I won't. Hey can you look after my dog I really want to go out tonight? No John, No I can't. Now I can see this is impacting John, his social life has gone to crap and frankly I could easily help him out if I wanted to, but I just won't. So am I the asshole here?\"\"\"",

Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge.

He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3.

I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.   I recently broke down and told them and said it wasn't fair that I was only 21 and my dad was already almost 84.  I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out.

Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out.

We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.  My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.   I recently broke down and told them and said it wasn't fair that I was only 21 and my dad was already almost 84.  I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.

He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later.

First wife moved and lives in another state with the kids, all teens now.\r\n\r\nWe met three and a half years ago, a year after my separation from my wife, before the divorce. I made it amicable for the sake of the kids and not spending a lot on lawyers, but except where the kids are concerned, I have no relationship with the Ex.  That being said, the two ladies do NOT get along, but more ice than fire.  I generally try to maintain detente for the sake of not traumatizing the kids when all of us are together.  I proposed to New Wife this last February while I was stationed in the Middle East (she was visiting) and we married in July (while I was on leave home). We finally moved into the same house this month. Well, combining households, I'm opening her boxes and she's opening mine, some I haven't seen since before I moved overseas, before I proposed.\r\n\r\nShe finds 4 tote-boxes of former family photos. Most all of which are of the kids growing up and me with the ex, but also some of me and the Ex's wedding 19.5 years ago, photos when we dated, photos from the vow renewal before the separation, some in frames, some still in the photo-mat sleeves. I took half the family pics when I moved out, and honestly, I have not looked at them hardly since. Never did I thumb threw them in some wistful haze, wishing I was still with old wife. I mostly took them for the sake of giving continuity to the kids, intending to eventually pass them along as part of the family record, momentos of when things were still good. But truthfully, I didn't think much about them.\r\n\r\nNew Wife was VERY upset. She understood (sort of) about the kid pix, and passing those along, but was taken aback by the volume of pix, and the fact that I had not excised the dating, wedding, or vow renewal pics at any time in the last 5 years. We had a fight/cry session and she's soaking In the tub, truly annoyed with me. I admit her feelings are valid, but I don't see there's anything to really be upset about. The past is past.

            "input": "AITA: New Wife Finds Boxes of Old Wife Photos, Wonders Why Not Thrown Out After 5 Years | So, I'm (48M) recently remarried to a wonderful, sweet woman (47F), my second marriage (first one fell apart after 15 years and three kids, due to my work and military moving lifestyle, and the Ex's (47F) infidelity and homesickness, lack of communication both ways) and my new wife's first marriage (serial dater, got close twice, focused on job later, never had kids until step-momming mine/ours). First wife moved and lives in another state with the kids, all teens now.\r\n\r\nWe met three and a half years ago, a year after my separation from my wife, before the divorce. I made it amicable for the sake of the kids and not spending a lot on lawyers, but except where the kids are concerned, I have no relationship with the Ex.  That being said, the two ladies do NOT get along, but more ice than fire.  I generally try to maintain detente for the sake of not traumatizing the kids when all of us are together.  I proposed to New Wife this last February while I was stationed in the Middle East (she was visiting) and we married in July (while I was on leave home). We finally moved into the same house this month. Well, combining households, I'm opening her boxes and she's opening mine, some I haven't seen since before I moved overseas, before I proposed.\r\n\r\nShe finds 4 tote-boxes of former family photos. Most all of which are of the kids growing up and me with the ex, but also some of me and the Ex's wedding 19.5 years ago, photos when we dated, photos from the vow renewal before the separation, some in frames, some still in the photo-mat sleeves. I took half the family pics when I moved out, and honestly, I have not looked at them hardly since. Never did I thumb threw them in some wistful haze, wishing I was still with old wife. I mostly took them for the sake of giving continuity to the kids, intending to eventually pass them along as part of the family record, momentos of when things were still good. But truthfully, I didn't think much about them.\r\n\r\nNew Wife was VERY upset. She understood (sort of) about the kid pix, and passing those along, but was taken aback by the volume of pix, and the fact that I had not excised the dating, wedding, or vow renewal pics at any time in the last 5 years. We had a fight/cry session and she's soaking In the tub, truly annoyed with me. I admit her feelings are valid, but I don't see there's anything to really be upset about. The past is past. We both had relationships and full lives prior to meeting. She excised everything post relationship, but then again, she wasn't married with kids. Me, I never thought about it anymore, never sought catharsis that way. Now, she's moody, somehow this makes me mad because this shouldn't be held against me, so we're both at odds.\r\n\r\nAm I the asshole?",

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event.

(where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

        "model_response": "**Verdict: not wrong**\n\nIn this situation, you took a necessary step to protect your family, especially your young daughter and fianc\u00e9e, from a potentially dangerous situation. Your father's disregard for safety protocols regarding his medical condition, particularly the disposal of syringes, posed a risk to your household. You attempted to communicate your concerns multiple times, and when he continued to ignore them, you made a difficult decision to prioritize the safety and well-being of your immediate family. \n\nWhile it\u2019s understandable that your father may be upset, your actions were justified given the circumstances. You provided him with a motel room and have been financially supporting him, which shows that you still care about his well-being despite the difficult decision you made. Your family\u2019s reaction may stem from their feelings about your father\u2019s health and their own relationship with him, but that doesn\u2019t negate the validity of your concerns. \n\nOverall, you are not the asshole for prioritizing your family's safety and setting boundaries.",

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

I asked her why Haley did those things to her and she said Haley was jealous of her looks, her popularity, and the fact that she always got it her way. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend said they aren\u2019t the best of friends, but Haley has sincerely apologized for her actions and has told my girlfriend the reasons she humiliated her was out of jealousy, but that she has found self-love and wasn\u2019t jealous of anyone anymore. My girlfriend also said Haley only seemed to take her jealous rage out at her and not anybody else. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe other four people met up at my girlfriend\u2019s house and we drove up to the ski resort. Haley seemed like a chill girl. On the ride there, I asked her about how she met my girlfriend and what it was like being volleyball teammates with her. She brought up the volleyball incidence herself, said she was deeply repentent about it, and asked me if my girlfriend ever told me about it. Right after I said yes, my girlfriend told us to stop talking about it. \r\n\r\n\r\nHaley once again apologized to my girlfriend for treating her like shit. My girlfriend told her she already forgave her years ago and begged Haley to stop beating herself up about it.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy. It means a lot to me.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA if I returned a yard sale sign to the address it advertises | I live at the end of a very busy intersection & someone put a sign in my devil strip to advertise their yard sale.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

I recently moved into a rent house in February. Prior to moving in I made an agreement with the landlord that I would clean the house, pressure wash, and take care of the yard for exchange of a discounted deposit and rent. The previous tenants of the home left without paying and left it a wreck. Anyways, the yard had been overgrown for the better part of a year, so very high grass and weeds. I don\u2019t have a huge yard but it\u2019s definitely pretty big, I\u2019d say around 30x50 combined. My across the street neighbor was friendly at first, the guy had been laid off work for 5 years and wasn\u2019t all there but we often chatted everyday when I got home from work. He was injured and let me know he gets paid about $4,000 monthly. He offered to cut my yard just like his, and his looked great for $60. I gladly paid him because after work, cleaning the house, and taking care of my daughter I was relatively busy. We had a pretty fair relationship, he would call me if he saw any body sketchy near my house, or pick up my garbage can out of the road, just neighbor stuff. Last week he asked when I wanted him to cut my grass again because it wasn\u2019t bad whatsoever. I told him that, he doesn\u2019t need to worry about it because it hasn\u2019t overgrown. I came home from work that night and it was cut so I went over and knocked and thanked him and we spoke. He asked about these boat trailers I had in the driveway that belonged to my landlord and if she was willing to sell them. I spoke with my landlord yesterday, and gave him a call this morning just letting him know the information about the trailers, he then texted me asking me if I was planning to pay him for cutting my grass last week.

I recently moved into a rent house in February. Prior to moving in I made an agreement with the landlord that I would clean the house, pressure wash, and take care of the yard for exchange of a discounted deposit and rent. The previous tenants of the home left without paying and left it a wreck. Anyways, the yard had been overgrown for the better part of a year, so very high grass and weeds. I don\u2019t have a huge yard but it\u2019s definitely pretty big, I\u2019d say around 30x50 combined. My across the street neighbor was friendly at first, the guy had been laid off work for 5 years and wasn\u2019t all there but we often chatted everyday when I got home from work. He was injured and let me know he gets paid about $4,000 monthly. He offered to cut my yard just like his, and his looked great for $60. I gladly paid him because after work, cleaning the house, and taking care of my daughter I was relatively busy. We had a pretty fair relationship, he would call me if he saw any body sketchy near my house, or pick up my garbage can out of the road, just neighbor stuff. Last week he asked when I wanted him to cut my grass again because it wasn\u2019t bad whatsoever. I told him that, he doesn\u2019t need to worry about it because it hasn\u2019t overgrown. I came home from work that night and it was cut so I went over and knocked and thanked him and we spoke. He asked about these boat trailers I had in the driveway that belonged to my landlord and if she was willing to sell them. I spoke with my landlord yesterday, and gave him a call this morning just letting him know the information about the trailers, he then texted me asking me if I was planning to pay him for cutting my grass last week. I didn\u2019t want to seem rude, so I agreed and asked if $20 was okay, my neighbor responded by saying he\u2019s only going to charge me $50 for it.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.  My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.   I recently broke down and told them and said it wasn't fair that I was only 21 and my dad was already almost 84.  I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.

I feel robbed of 30 years with my parents.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For bringing whiskey to a party? | Throwaway, since college me and a large group of friends have always been big drinkers (at our heaviest, we were drinking ~30-40 units per week, mostly on weekends). A few years after college, one of our friends ended up getting an enlarged liver which, while it wasn't severe and the rest of us were still healthy, scared us into wanting to sober up more and take a break.\r\n\r\nSo we made a pact to try to stay clean. It was nothing formal, i.e stop drinking completely. Just to slow down/stop at our own pace. Time went by and the pact was largely successful, most stopped completely, a couple drastically reduced their drinking. \r\n\r\nSo cut towards last weekend, one of my friends (one who slowed down his drinking and only drinks on special occasions) was having a birthday party. Many of my friends who were involved in the pact were there with a couple of others who weren't. I figured it's been awhile so us having a drink to celebrate couldn't hurt.\r\n\r\nWhen I unveiled the whiskey at the party, the host seemed uncomfortable but since some of the at the party were drinkers, he allowed it, I set it aside and didn't think too much about it. Later on, a couple of other friends who stayed sober came up to me and said \"why would you bring whiskey for a get together with us?\"\r\n\r\nI reiterated that there were a couple of people at the party who were never involved in the pact. One of my other friends said \"the whiskey is hard to look at...\"\r\n\r\nAnd throughout the night, I was bitched at by people in the pact to get rid of the whiskey.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.   I recently broke down and told them and said it wasn't fair that I was only 21 and my dad was already almost 84.  I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her.

He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him.

My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.   I recently broke down and told them and said it wasn't fair that I was only 21 and my dad was already almost 84.  I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords.

They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot!

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger. With her I feel like I can show my true emotions and I don't need to walk on eggshells- I just feel more comfortable. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for getting annoyed at my girlfriend when she makes mistakes?\r\n\r\nEdit: I do also want to clarify that I do have a temper and I'm aware and I do know that sometimes I get mad sort of easily but I always leave for a little bit to cool down and I do apologize if I've felt I've crossed a line.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling anyone I got married? | When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license.

She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family.

I recently broke down and told them and said it wasn't fair that I was only 21 and my dad was already almost 84.  I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.  My dad didn't say anything but I could tell he was pissed.  My sister has expressed similar feelings.  I feel robbed of 30 years with my parents.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my cousin that her flirtatious hair flipping makes me uncomfortable? | Hey yo. So my cousin (19F) has been staying at our house for like a month now. In the house are me (17M), my brother (20M), my parents, and my grandma. I\u2019ll admit right now that I\u2019m a bit narcissistic. I think pretty much every girl is into me. I\u2019m usually pretty accurate though, according to my friends. My narcissism isn\u2019t unfounded though. I was the starting shooting guard on the varsity basketball team and I\u2019m good-looking. My brother on the other hand is more average. \r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing that has been irking me lately is my cousin\u2019s flirtatious hair flipping, where she runs her hand through her long hair ad cranks her neck sideways and back or just shakes her head left to right to get her hair flowing. This seems like a new habit. She does this tens of times a day. I never really got the feeling that she was into me before, but it sure seems like it now. It might be because I\u2019m more mature now. She seems to be very enthralled in whatever I have to say and she\u2019s always hanging out with me whenever I\u2019m outside my room. I don\u2019t mind that. I just don\u2019t like it when she makes her flirting so obvious, \u00e0 la the flirtatious hair flipping. A few times a day when I\u2019m in her presence, she would do the hair flipping. It makes me very uncomfortable. She would also do it sometimes when other family members are around, but I notice it more often when it\u2019s just her and I. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhile just her and I were in the living room yesterday diddling on our phones, I noticed her flirtatiously hair flipping six times in an hour. It happened four times while we were talking and she was sure she had my attention. I told her after the sixth time that her flirtatious hair flipping makes me uncomfortable. She asked me what the hell I was talking about. I explained to her that she\u2019s doing what most girls do when they\u2019re into a guy and it\u2019s very uncomfortable for me so she should stop. She said I\u2019m full of myself and to stop being so god damn gross. I asked her why she was flipping her hair then. She said girls do that more often than I think and not for the reason that I think. I asked her what the reason was then. She said it\u2019s just to make sure her hair is in order. I said okay incredulously. We were sitting awkwardly in silence for the next hour. I didn\u2019t notice her flipping her hair. \r\n\r\n\r\nShe told my brother about this incident when he came over. My brother said he couldn\u2019t believe that I actually thought our cousin was flipping her hair because of me. I asked him why he couldn\u2019t believe that. He said it\u2019s because she\u2019s our fucking cousin who has a boyfriend and that I\u2019m not as hot as I think I am. I didn\u2019t want to get into a competition with him because I like to show respect to my elders, but I\u2019m legit a 9 and he\u2019s like a 7. Even our older relatives have said that I\u2019m the most handsome one of all. I\u2019m also 2 inches taller. I told him to think whatever he wants to think.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn\u2019t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn\u2019t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn\u2019t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn\u2019t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.\r\n\r\nAnd then five days later she died. \r\n\r\nAfter that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that \u2014 even if we hadn\u2019t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she\u2019d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.\r\n\r\nA few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I\u2019d \u201chidden\u201d it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she\u2019s coming from, I really do \u2014 but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I\u2019ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split \u2014 some people totally understand why I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on \u201cyet,\u201d because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just want to thank you all for your sympathy.

Our PARENTS pay for the apartment and they let us live in it. We 0 expenses towards the apartment. Now both my sisters names our on the lease but mine isnt. The reason for that was because I didnt live her when they first moved in the 3rd bedroom was always ment for me to move into but I was 17 when they moved in. We are working on putting me on the lease. Now keep in mind my parents pay for EVERYTHING for us. My parents own a bunch of companies and have enough money to support us. All of us were going to college but our semesters got canceled. So we basically just live in a apartment in walking distance of our college for no reason. Today I ordered pizza and left the box with 5 slices still inside on the table. Well my 23YO sister yelled at me for leaving trash on the table I said it still had food in it and she then told me to put it in the fridge then i said no I'm going to eat it in like a hour why would i put it away? She then went on a rant how I never follow the house rules. She said the next time I dont follow rules she is making me move back into our parents until college starts again I said she cant do that she doesnt even pay for the apartment the only people that can kick me out is our parents or the landlords. She tried to say our parents put in as the head of the house but that never happened.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for kicking my (now former) friend out of our holiday accommodation? | For my birthday a few weeks ago, I organised a long weekend with my closest friends for my birthday. They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO.

They all live in different places so it was easier to meet in another country. It took me a lot of time to organise everything and plan, and it also cost me a lot of money because out of the 4 nights, not everyone could stay the whole thing. I covered the price of accommodation for the nights after they each left (about half of the total price). All my friends knew how important is was for me for multiple reasons. \r\n\r\nOne of my friend (let's call him Tom) does not speak to another friend (let's call him Henri) because they had a little argument a few months back and Tom said he would rather just ignore the issue than talk about it. Tom, Henri and myself are part of a group of friends. Tom has been my friend for a while but lately it has been more about me supporting him and a one sided relationship. \r\n\r\nFor about one month before the trip, Tom stopped talking to me. He was just replying with one or two words when I was asking about something related to the trip and ignoring anything else I was saying. At that point, I was worried it might make a problem during the trip.\r\n\r\nFast forward to said trip. Tom missed his flight, so was scheduled to arrive two days later than planned. The day he did arrive, he did not tell us when he would land or anything like that. I sent him the code for the accommodation the day before, and we just found him on the couch the next day when we came back after visiting stuff.\r\n\r\nHe was acting odd and was not speaking much when Henri or myself were in the room. He spent the first evening literally turning his back at us and sulking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, we were all getting ready to leave for breakfast but there did not seem to be a sign of Tom. I decided that it would be best to talk about it because the issue between Tom and Henri was getting really annoying and I did not want it to ruin my holidays. So I asked Henri to come with me and we went to Tom's room. That day was my birthday and it was kind of a big deal for me. \r\n\r\nI told him that I wanted things to be talked through because it was not a nice atmosphere. He did not say a thing. I told Tom we were going out for breakfast and asked what his plans were. He then literally told us he did not want to see us so he would just plan to go to any place where we weren't. At that point I got really angry because I felt incredibly disrespected. I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either.

In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.

Gaming is a big part of our relationship- it's a hobby that we share and enjoy. We normally play FPS/Survival games together. They're not my gf's favorite and she says that she sucks at shooters but I think she's pretty good.\r\n \r\nAnyway, the other day we were just messing around and shooting each other and she wound up killing me. I got pretty pissed and annoyed as I felt that she took it too far. I asked why she did that and she could tell I was annoyed so she apologized but I asked her again and she told me that she thought we were having fun and I just told her that it was annoying that she took it that far. She argued that a mutual friend of ours killed me the other day when we were doing the same thing and I laughed. \r\n\r\nSo this incident basically caused her to vent and she says that it's not right that I'm nicer to other people than I am to her. She says that when strangers and our mutual friends make mistakes that I'm understanding and patient and laugh if off but when she does that I get angry. She tells me that it gives her anxiety sometimes when we play together because she feels like she has to be really good and play perfectly or else I'm going to get mad at her. I told her that's silly and that I don't expect her to play perfectly but I do expect her not to make silly mistakes. And as far as other people making mistakes- it's different because I sort of expect it from them whereas with her I know her abilities. Also, sometimes I'll just be patient or laugh with other people because I don't want to seem like an asshole to a stranger.

I told him that if he did not want to see us, I would rather him go sleep somewhere else.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing and just packed his stuff, and left about 5 minutes later. He then proceeded to block us both on all the platforms where we usually talk.\r\n\r\nFor me, that friendship is done. But I am not sure if Henri and myself where TA here, so I am putting in here for people to judge me.\r\n\r\nEdit: I did ask him repeatedly if he was alright when he stopped replying. For the few months before that I provided help in the form of moral support, providing accommodation, loaning money and getting food for him. I probably come up as a spoiled brat here because I don't address it, but I did do all I could think off to help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for telling my sister she can't bring her emotional support dog to a family trip? | My (23F) whole family is planning a vacation soon where we will all be staying in a small cabin my uncle owns together. It\u2019s going to be a camping type adventure with lots of great activities planned and I\u2019m really looking forward to it. My sister (25F) is now saying she plans to bring her emotional support dog along. Now I have a problem with this because we are all cramming into this cabin in the first place no extra beds some people are even planning to be on sleeping bags on the floor. Her dog is also very untrained, it\u2019s not even a year old, super hyper jumping on people barking. It isn\u2019t even house trained completely and is just a total whirlwind. We couldn\u2019t even put it outside because there is no fence or anything to contain it and the wildlife would definitely have the upper hand where it to wander away. Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I\u2019m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health. I\u2019ve talked to my brother and he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea either. WIBTA for telling her she can't bring the dog?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For not \"checking\" with my boyfriend before I shower? | \\*Using a friends reddit account because I don't have one of my own\\*\r\n\r\nI (26f) recently moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years (26m) as an only child from a family with above average means, I've never shared a bathroom with anyone. In college I lived in a studio apartment alone. (where I was still living before moving in) I've been here about a month now, and things have been going fine except this issue.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 times I go to take a shower now, my boyfriend barges in to go to the bathroom. He says it's common courtesy that before spending a long time occupying the 1 bathroom, that you check with the other people in the house to make sure no one needs to use the restroom. He is an adult male with zero health issues, so I don't understand why he feels he gets access to the bathroom 24/7. If I were in their for an hour or something I would understand, but holding it for 30 minutes hardly seems like a big deal.  I've tried to announce when I go to take a shower, but honestly sometimes I don't think about it, because it's just part of my routine. He gets so frustrated when I don't seek him out to tell him I'll be in the bathroom. That it's causing tension, mainly due to the fact he has started coming in when I'm in the shower if he needs to use the bathroom instead of just waiting. I've started getting annoyed back, because what if I was sick and on the toilet myself for 30 minutes, he'd have to hold it then, so why can't he hold it while I'm in the shower? We are both 100% convinced we are right and neither is willing to budge. AITA for not checking whether or not he needs to use the bathroom before I shower?\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nRIP my friends inbox! Per her request, I'll update and clear some things up. \r\n\r\n1. I have to leave the door cracked for our cats, they've been known to pee other places if blocked from their liter box\r\n2. he ONLY barges in, IF I haven't told him ahead of time. He comes in, pees, and says \"You should have warned me\" He knows how I feel about being walked in on, so it feels like he is trying to punish me for an oversight on my part. if we are in the same room, or he is nearby I DO mention if I'm getting in the shower, but the times I don't are usually early in the morning when I wake up, and don't even know where he is. He is usually outside in the garage, or down in the basement. I don't feel I should have to hunt him down to ask him if he needs to use the bathroom like he's a toddler.\r\n3. I am a private and modest person, something my boyfriend has always known about me. I am not comfortable sharing a room with someone relieving themselves, which he knows, and I'm certainly not comfortable having someone walk in on me in the shower, fully exposed. Our bathroom is shaped like an L with the shower and the toilet in the lower part, and the sinks running up the length. The shower is a huge walk in with a sliding glass door. So I'm on full display. Again, not a new thing, he KNOWS this about me, and before I moved in, was usually quite respectful about it. (Maybe one day I'll be comfortable with it, but it's been a month!)\r\n4. When I said \"we both think we are right and not willing to budge\" I meant, we both refuse to budge on who is right in this situation. Not that we are breaking up over it, or that its a deal breaker. Just I don't think I should have to ask permission to use the shower, and he shouldn't automatically get first dibs just because he wants them. \r\n5. I'd also like to point out, while he does let me know if he is getting in the shower, he does NOT alert me when he goes #2 which has taken him up to 40 minutes on occasion because he is playing on his phone. Thereby occupying the bathroom longer than I do (the 30 minutes was the longest and usually just once or twice a week when it's time to shave and condition, normally its between 15-20) I just KNOCK and ask him to hurry if I need to use the bathroom, something I am not granted when I'm showering, as he just comes in no warning (usually scaring me half to death because he BANGS the door.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to read all the comments, but there is quite a lot! Hopefully I've cleared up anything asked in INFO. Thanks!\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting mad at my parents for having me and my sister at such a late age. | My parents were 42 and 62 when they had me, and my sister they were 45 and 66 respectively.  My father just turned 83 and is not doing well, and has never been able to be a father because of his age.   I recently broke down and told them and said it wasn't fair that I was only 21 and my dad was already almost 84.  I felt terrible after, but I still fell very sad that my kids wont know their grandparents, and that most of my friends parents are still in their 40s/early50s.  My dad didn't say anything but I could tell he was pissed.  My sister has expressed similar feelings.  I feel robbed of 30 years with my parents.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for reporting my dad's girlfriend to her employer? | I [22F] am a smoker. My parents are obviously not crazy about it, so I try to respect them by not doing it in their presence, or even coming around them smelling like smoke.\r\n\r\nLast month, I went to the store my dad's girlfriend works to buy a pack of cigarettes. When I get home, I found a ton of missed calls from my dad. When I opened my WhatsApp, lo and behold, pictures of me standing in the line in the store. She sent them to my dad. He was mad, rightfully so, but he got over it eventually. \r\n\r\nI contacted head office of this store, and they sent the case back to the branch manager. She called me today to hear my story. I didn't give a name, on purpose, but then she figured it out; she said that the girlfriend would be suspended until such a time that I can go back home (I'm in another city rn) and give a statement in a hearing for this lady. \r\n\r\nAyt, cool. So my dad calls me, and he's absolutely losing his shit, throwing all kinds of emotional blackmail out in the air. At the end of the call he said that I have 24 hours to withdraw the complaint, or he will tell everybody in our family that I have turned against him.\r\n\r\nTL;DR AITA for reporting my dad's girlfriend to her employers for taking pictures of me while I was buying cigarettes in the store she works at?\"\"\"",
