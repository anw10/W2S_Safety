They got super pissed off and said we shouldn\u2019t be doing that when we\u2019re sleeping out in the open and it\u2019s inappropriate.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you and your girlfriend were simply being affectionate and comfortable with each other, which is a natural part of a relationship. However, it's also important to consider the feelings and expectations of her parents, especially since you were staying in their home. \n\nWhile you may not have intended to offend anyone, it might be wise to acknowledge their feelings and apologize for any discomfort caused. This doesn't mean you were wrong in your actions, but rather that you can show respect for their household rules and boundaries. \n\nIn conclusion, it seems like a misunderstanding rather than a serious issue. A sincere apology and a conversation with her parents about their expectations could help resolve the situation.",

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a really tough situation, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed and hurt. It's important to remember that both you and your girlfriend are dealing with your own mental health challenges, and it's not uncommon for relationships to become strained in such circumstances.\n\nFrom what you've described, it seems like there are significant trust issues and emotional pain on both sides. It's not wrong to feel resentful or to question her actions, especially after being hurt by her infidelity. However, it's also essential to communicate openly about your feelings and concerns rather than letting them fester.\n\nIf you feel that she is using her mental health struggles to manipulate you, it's crucial to address that directly with her. Healthy relationships require honesty and accountability from both partners. It might be beneficial for both of you to seek professional help, either individually or as a couple, to navigate these complex emotions and improve your communication.\n\nUltimately, you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel valued and respected. If you feel that this relationship is causing you more pain than joy, it may be worth considering whether it's the right fit for you. Remember to prioritize your own mental health and well-being.",

It's understandable to want to address issues that affect your community, especially when they involve illegal activities that impact public spaces.\n\nWhile it's important to approach such situations with empathy and understanding, it's also reasonable to expect local laws and regulations to be enforced. You have the right to voice your concerns and seek assistance from authorities when you believe someone is not adhering to the rules that are in place for the safety and well-being of the community.\n\nIn this case, it doesn't seem like you are in the wrong for wanting to report the situation. You are advocating for your neighborhood and trying to ensure that everyone follows the same rules. It's unfortunate that your concerns were met with negativity, but it's important to remember that not everyone will understand your perspective.\n\nUltimately, you are not the asshole for wanting to address a situation that you believe is harmful to your community.

Sorry for bad formatting, I\u2019m on mobile. \n\nI (31 f) moved across country with my boyfriend about a year ago and transferred from the department store I was working at to one over here. My job is to provide customer service, set up orders, and it\u2019s a very chill job where you stand around and approach people as they come through.  \n\nWhen i started this job initially on east coast, everyone was friendly, helpful and people who didn\u2019t know me made a point to include me. Over here it\u2019s different, I\u2019ve been open and friendly but it was hard to make friends here. After a month or two, I started to think maybe they didn\u2019t want to talk and this was a job and to focus on that, while still being friendly if people wanted to talk. \n\nToday a coworker(55m) whose moving to another department told me he initially became friends with me because I looked lost and he wanted to make be the person who would actually talk to me. I know, I know... it might sound sweet like he was trying to be friendly and saying he was reaching out to me... but I read it as him saying he became friends with me because he felt bad for me. I do talk to a lot of coworkers now and have made friends in a new department. \n\nafter he said that, I kind of avoided him the rest of the day because I don\u2019t want to be a pity friend.

It's understandable to want to avoid someone who makes you feel like they are only being friendly out of pity. However, it's also important to recognize that he may have had good intentions in trying to reach out to you. \n\nUltimately, it sounds like you have made friends in your new department and are doing well in your job. It's okay to take a step back from someone who makes you uncomfortable, but it might be worth considering having a conversation with him to clarify your feelings. \n\nIn this case, I would say you are not the asshole (NTA) for wanting to avoid someone who makes you feel uncomfortable, but it might be helpful to communicate your feelings directly to him if the situation arises again.",

I told her that I like her daughter and don\u2019t mind taking her in as my own and I\u2019ll give her as much time as she needs, but she told me to please just drop this discussion. \n\n\nI got a bit annoyed and asked her what was the purpose of this pact if we are not going to honor it. She says it\u2019s a lot different never having been married than having been married and divorced, that I would never understand her reservations. She says if and when she\u2019s ready to discuss our marriage pact, she will. I told her that\u2019s fine and wished her well. In the meantime, I\u2019m not expecting much out of this marriage pact and will keep dating and finding the one for me.",

We met 9 years ago at a salsa workshop and have since become partners in life and dance, so to speak. We have won several local salsa competitions and are active in the salsa community. When we go to parties and weddings we like to perform a salsa routine because it livens up the mood and people seem to like it. We have never had any complaints and people always treat it as a delightful surprise. \n\nMy coworker at my day job Dave (31M) got married this weekend. Of course, at the reception I discretely asked the DJ to play my favorite song to dance to, and  as soon as it started playing my wife and I began our routine. We got a lot of positive attention and at the end everyone clapped for our performance. I didn\u2019t see Dave or his wife but I figured they wouldn\u2019t mind that my wife and I were enjoying ourselves and celebrating the occasion. However, later that night Dave told me that he thought our dance was a \u201cdick move\u201d and accused me of showing off and trying to make the wedding about me. I told him that was never my intention. Someone else stole him away to congratulate him and I assumed everything was okay. However, this week at my day job Dave has been ignoring me and passive aggressive. Everyone else at work has said that they liked our dance and thought Dave was making a big deal out of nothing.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that your intentions were good, and you were simply trying to celebrate the occasion in a fun and lively way. However, it's important to consider the perspective of the couple getting married. While many guests may have enjoyed your performance, it's possible that Dave felt it overshadowed their special day or took attention away from them.\n\nIt's understandable that you might feel hurt by his reaction, especially since you received positive feedback from other guests. However, communication is key in resolving misunderstandings. It might be helpful to have a conversation with Dave to express your intentions and hear his perspective. \n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance between celebrating your passion for dance and respecting the wishes of the couple whose wedding it is. If you feel that performing at weddings may cause drama in the future, it might be worth reconsidering that tradition. But based on the information provided, it doesn't seem like you were in the wrong for wanting to share your joy through dance.",

While you may not have intended to hurt anyone's feelings, it's important to be mindful of how our words can affect others. \n\nIn this case, it might be best to apologize to the friend of a friend and explain that you didn't mean to offend her. It's a learning opportunity to be more aware of language that can be hurtful, even if it's not directed at someone specifically. \n\nSo, in this case, you might be the \"not the asshole\" but it's a good idea to reflect on the situation and consider the feelings of others in the future.",

I drive Mercedes Benz c300 manual transmission that my dad use to own and he gave it to me as a high school graduation gift back in 2010 and now my dad is dead from lung cancer and the car is a not only a car to Me. It's a precious souvenir and it reminds me of my dad. It was my dad's prized possession and it is now mine and because it was my dads prized posseion, I made sure to take care of the car   and part of taking care of it and making sure it stays as intact as possible is not letting anyone else drive it. No one else drove the car but me. I never sat in the passenger seat since my dad gave it to me. 3 weeks ago, my wife got rear ended and her car is now totalled and she has no car. But we live in a city where there is public transport and I tell her that she can take the bus if she needs to go out. But she is been begging me to let her use my car but I keep saying no despite that i keep explaining to her that it is my dad's prized possession and I do not wish to share it. The other day she got mad at me after I woudlnt let her use my car to go see her mother who lives 30 minutes away from the city and I thought that was so childish. But when I talked to my sisters about it, they said that I should be more trusting and be willing to share my prized possession with my wife but the thing is, it's not only my prized possesions, it's also my dad's prized possession and if i let anyone drive it and they crash it, it would be like losing my dad a second time. My sister disagrees with me and says that my level of distrust is not healthy for a marriage but my best friend and 3 brothers are on my side. My best friend even said that you should never let a woman drive your car. Am I an asshole for not letting my wife drive my car ?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that the underlying issue is about trust and communication in the marriage. While it's understandable that you want to protect your father's prized possession, it's also important to consider your wife's feelings and the dynamics of your relationship. \n\nYour refusal to let her drive the car may come across as a lack of trust or respect for her capabilities, which can be damaging to your relationship. It's essential to have an open and honest conversation with your wife about your feelings and concerns regarding the car, while also listening to her perspective. \n\nUltimately, it's important to find a balance between protecting something that holds sentimental value and being a supportive partner. So, while your intentions may not be wrong, the way you are handling the situation could be perceived as inconsiderate. It may be beneficial to reevaluate your stance and work towards a compromise that respects both your feelings and your wife's needs.",

Partly to get it off my chest and partly because this sub needs more assholes and fewer validation stories.\n\nThis is a true story from a very long time ago that I've only shared with maybe 3 people in my real life. I was driving on a very long, straight highway for a very long time. There was pretty much nothing around; just 3 lanes going east, 3 lanes going west, a median in the middle, and then a ditch on the side. On the other side of the ditch was a slight incline upward.\n\nI was cruising along at about 80 mph while the flow of traffic was closer to about 75. I was in the left lane, slowly passing the other cars and was not weaving in and out of lanes or anything. This was satisfactory for a long time. At some point though, a black SUV flew up behind me. He must have been going over 100 because he approached me very quickly. He got a little too close for comfort, and there was a car to my right so I couldn't get out of his way immediately.\n\nThe next part of the story basically happened in bullet time. It was maybe 10 seconds at most.\n\n**I held my ground and he held his; he was tailgating way too aggressively so I gave a little break check.**\n\nThe SUV backed off suddenly and seemed to get the message at first. While he was backing off, I was starting to pull ahead of the car that was blocking the middle-lane and \\*probably\\* could've safely cut over in front of them but I didn't.\n\nBut that only lasted a few seconds. The SUV began creeping up on me again. By this point, \\*he\\* could've cut to the middle lane safely too. Either of us could have, but neither did. He wanted to prove his might and make me move over, and I didn't like being tailgated. Neither was budging. I had sped up to about 95 by this point btw. My engine was straining because the car was a POS.\n\n**He aggressively flew up so close I literally thought he was going to ram me.**\n\nI was actually surprised he \\*didn't\\* hit me, that's how close he was. I couldn't see most of his grill in my rearview at all. I panicked for a second and slammed on the gas pedal to get some space behind me. And here's the big fuckup: Once I had about a car length of space, I gave him another break check. It was a brief tap, not enough to make my tires squeal or anything. But still, a break check at over 90mph while being tailgated.\n\nThe SUV's driver lost control of the vehicle. I saw him veer onto the median to my left and he actually began \\*passing\\* me at first. This makes me think that maybe my break check came at the same time as another one of his ramming bluff attempts; he was speeding up at the same time I checked him.\n\nWhile still on the grass median he slowed slightly, suddenly cut hard to the right to try to get back on to the road (hopefully not to try to ram me?) and I saw the SUV in my rearview as he overshot the turn and went rightward nearly perpendicular to the highway. He went across all three lanes, went down noseward into the ditch, and slammed into the embankment. I watched the SUV shrinking into the distance in my mirror as it flipped up in the air, rolled over and over several times and came to a stop upside-down just above the ditch.\n\n**The SUV was upside down, all of its windows shattered, probably half a mile behind me by now.**\n\nI was frozen. My knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The song \"Guilty\" by Judge D was playing, appropriately enough, and this scene was permanently etched into my brain while watching what just happened. All the moral questions and doubts and what-ifs and holy shits were flooding my mind at once. In the span of maybe 1.5 seconds I contemplated what just happened and my role in it.\n\nWhy didn't he pass on the right instead of the median? Why didn't I? Did anyone die? Was there a baby in the car? Holy shit what if I just killed or injured somebody? Are the cops going to catch me? How fucked am I? Am I going to be able to live with myself if I don't pull right the fuck over right the fuck now?\n\n**I decided to do the right thing or at least something close to it.**\n\nI pulled over. I got out of the car, began calling 911 while sprinting desperately toward the scene. I didn't give my name but I kept things vague for now, just in case. I told them an accident happened and there may be injuries, and gave my approximate location. I ended the call, still sprinting and out of breath, as I approached a group of other drivers who'd pulled over about 50 yards from the SUV.\n\nFrom this distance I could see its windows were all shattered and the driver and passengers were standing around looking pissed. I asked the group near me whether anyone was hurt and what happened. One of them told me he'd just come from talking to the driver and said nobody was hurt but they were furious about some asshole that had \"tried to ram them off the road\" (which I did not do).\n\nThat was enough to satisfy my at-that-time greyish moral compass. I felt like there was no benefit to me sticking around and getting fucked over by his situation; it was physically a one-car accident, nobody was hurt, and he was not able to control his vehicle.\n\nLooking back, I'm selfishly glad I stopped. If I hadn't, I would still be wondering to this day (15ish years later) if someone's child was killed or something.\n\n**So here's my moral dilemma. How much of an asshole was I?**\n\nIf someone else were telling this story I'd probably go with ESH.\n\n**In my defense:**\n\n* Point 1: He was the one in control of his vehicle, not me. He made the decision to swerve left onto the median instead of right into a clear lane. He had made the decision to aggressively tailgate me, repeatedly, until he lost control of his own vehicle.\n* Point 2: He was being recklessly aggressive. A responsible driver should maintain enough distance in front of them that \\*any\\* emergency can be responded to immediately. The driver in front (me in this case) could break or swerve at any moment to avoid an animal or obstacle, and you have to be prepared for that. He was unable to control his vehicle when the emergency arose (my brake check).\n* Point 3: This was entirely unnecessary from the beginning. We were both already significantly speeding when he first approached me, and 85mph is a very generous cruising speed on a 70mph highway on a clear day.\n\n**In his defense:**\n\n* Point 1: If either of us should have moved to the middle lane, it's me. It's illegal to pass on the right, so while it would've been safer for him to do so, it was really \\*my\\* responsibility.\n* Point 2: I didn't have to brake check him. I could've slowly coasted until he passed on the right, I could've sped up, I could've done a lot of things. But I chose to tap the brakes at over 90mph while being tailgated.\n* Point 3: I also did not approach him directly or speak to the police. I felt like I wasn't \\*really\\* involved in the accident, since our cars never touched, but I'm not a cop and it's not my place to make that call.  \n\n(side note, not really relevant.. I have changed my driving habits significantly since then. I now get the fuck out of the way when someone tailgates. It's not worth it.)\n\n**TL;DR**: Brake-checked an aggressive tailgater when I could've safely gotten out of the way. His car was destroyed, nobody was hurt, and I peaced the fuck out",
        "model_response": "**Reaction: this is wrong**\n\nYour actions contributed to a dangerous situation that could have resulted in serious injury or death. While the other driver was also at fault for aggressive driving and tailgating, you escalated the situation by brake-checking him at high speed. It's important to prioritize safety and avoid confrontations on the road. You should have either slowed down to allow him to pass or moved to another lane if possible. Leaving the scene without providing your information or checking on the occupants of the SUV was also irresponsible. It's good that you've reflected on this experience and changed your driving habits, but it's clear that this was a serious mistake.",

R does TikToks occasionally, and has that typical e-girl style a lot of people have nowadays: she dresses all in black clothes, skirts, has pink short hair, has bangs, loves using chains, that kind of stuff. She has a reasonable amount of followers in her TikTok and Instagram accounts.\n\nR recently made an account in onlyfans, a site where you can sell nudes of yourself. People pay a monthly fee IIRC and they can see your nudes. I see no problem in that itself.\n\nHowever, I shall remind you of a little detail: R got her popularity mainly from TikTok. TikTok is majoritarily used by underaged teens, and R's fanbase is almost fully composed by teenaged girls who aren't even 18 yet.\n\nThe problem is that R is *always* promoting her onlyfans account. She made it some weeks ago and most of her stories on Instagram promote her onlyfans - not only that, she romanticizes it a lot. A example I can give you is a post she made saying something in the lines of \"selling packs ((we call them nude packs in my language, not sure if it's the same in english)) is great; you don't have to stop working even in the pandemics!\"\n\nHonestly that made it for me. I know that a lot of underaged girls want to sell nudes because they see other, legal people doing it. I contacted R and asked her to stop promoting her nude packs so much, and explained my reasonings. She told me that she wouldn't stop doing it, and I insisted. She got somewhat mad at me, saying that it wasn't her fault anyways, and blocked me. She unblocked me shortly afterwards but we haven't talked since.\n\nReddit, AITA? Should I apologize? Was I in the wrong?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems like you were genuinely concerned for your friend's well-being and the potential impact her actions could have on her young audience. It's understandable to want to protect someone from making choices that could have negative consequences, especially when it comes to the impressionable nature of her followers.\n\nHowever, the way you approached the situation may not have been the most effective. Instead of insisting she stop promoting her OnlyFans account, it might have been more constructive to express your concerns in a way that encourages an open dialogue. It's important to remember that everyone has the right to make their own choices, even if we don't agree with them.\n\nIn this case, it might be best to reach out to her again, apologize for how you approached the conversation, and express that your intentions were to look out for her. This could help mend the friendship and allow for a more productive discussion about your concerns. Ultimately, it's important to respect her autonomy while also expressing your feelings.",

I saw how hard she worked on it and I know she saved her coins for the materials. We agreed on a price of $650, which I think is reasonable for an emerging artist.\n\nI guess Julie told her Dad and her sister about it. My brother called me up and asked me to buy something from Lily too. I honestly thought that he was joking so I laughed when he said it but he got mad. He said that it\u2019s not fair to gift one child something and not gift it to the other. Lily\u2019s self esteem is suffering and she feels inadequate.\n\nAnnoyed for being blamed for self esteem problems I told him maybe he should give Lily money himself if it will make him feel better, and hung up. \n\nMy brother is now trying to hold Julie\u2019s painting hostage.

It's understandable that you would not want to be extorted or pressured into buying something you do not want. \n\nUltimately, you should feel free to support the artist whose work you admire without feeling guilty about it. Your decision to buy Julie's painting is a reflection of your appreciation for her talent, and it's not an indictment of Lily's abilities.

My BF (27M) doesn't really understand my passion for animals. He never grew up around them and has never had much of an interest in my pets. He likes them, but he doesn't want anymore. When we moved in together a year ago, I had 3 geckos, 2 snakes, 2 rabbits, a turtle, 3 guinea pigs, a fish tank, a parrot, and 4 hamsters. They are all rescues. My boyfriend has expressed that he does not want anymore animals, and I have felt like 16 animals + a tank is a pretty solid compromise. Although I am within my means to care for all of these animals and they all get loads of personal attention, I don't want to bring in more animals than I can care for. 16 is a good number for me at the moment.\n\nMy boyfriend does not like my hams, rabbits, or guineas. He will engage with my other pets, but finds those 9 to be absolutely repulsive, which sucks because they're the animals I have felt such a deep connection with.\n\nA few days ago, I got a message from a friend, who said that someone they knew had a hamster that needed to be rehomed due to health issues. I asked for some photos of the animal, to see it's condition. The hamster was in extremely poor shape and when I reached out to local rescues, they all admitted they didn't have the ability to properly care for it. The photos I received showed a lot of clear neglect, and I knew I had to help out.\n\nThe day after I found out about the hamster, I texted my boyfriend to let him know I was planning on fostering a rescue ham, and assured him it would be very temporary. I no longer foster since moving in with my boyfriend, but before we lived together, I was a frequent foster carer for cats, dogs, rodents, etc. He didn't respond, but I went to go pick up the hamster so that I could bring it into a vet. In person, I could tell it's condition was much worse than initially represented, so I rushed it to the vet. Once I had gotten there, I saw I had a number of texts from my boyfriend.\n\nHe told me I was not allowed to bring the hamster home. He said he would seriously reconsider our relationship if I brought it home. He was absolutely furious. I told him the hamster was extremely sick and needed the help, but he wasn't listening. I tried to remind him that it was only temporary, but he said that I was being ridiculous and I was violating our agreement. Trying to compromise, I told him I would have the hamster rehomed in a week. He told me that I could either leave the rescue, or get rid of one of my personal hams and swap the rescue in for it. \n\nI know I went against what he explicitly asked. I just couldn't stand to see this baby suffer. The hamster had to be put down at the vet, so he never got to come home with me. My boyfriend is still deeply upset and things have been awful in our relationship since.\n\nAITA for disobeying my boyfriend and rescuing a hamster?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you had good intentions in trying to rescue the hamster, especially given its poor condition and the lack of support from local rescues. However, it is also important to consider your boyfriend's feelings and the agreement you both had regarding the number of pets in your home. \n\nWhile your desire to help the hamster is commendable, it appears that your boyfriend felt disregarded and disrespected when you went against his wishes. Communication is key in any relationship, and it seems that there was a breakdown in that aspect. \n\nUltimately, while your intentions were good, it may be worth reflecting on how to better communicate and compromise with your boyfriend in the future. It might also be helpful to have a deeper conversation about your shared values and expectations regarding pets and animal care. \n\nIn this case, it seems that both parties have valid points, and it may be beneficial to seek a resolution together rather than assigning blame.",

Instead of refusing outright, it might be more productive to have an open discussion with them about your concerns and come to a compromise. \n\nIn this case, it would be best to approach the situation with understanding and a willingness to listen to each other.

I refused to give her any. She hasn't tried much except for weed and I feel as though she doesn't know much about these sorts of drugs and has only really heard about their effects from my experiences with them. Aside from that, my main reasoning is that I care deeply for her and seriously don't want anything to happen to her. Even more so, if something did and it was because of me, I'd never forgive myself really. She trusts me and my judgement so I don't want to betray that by giving her a substance her body may react poorly to.\n\nAnyway, she lost it at me and her point is obviously that she is an adult and can do as she pleases. Fair enough, I also told her that if she wants to go source it and pay for it herself, I cannot stop her. I'd still be uncomfortable with it... But I wouldn't be the one enabling her or dealing to her.\n\nI am protective of her, but am I being overprotective? Most of them time I don't think I'm like this.

We have been together for 3 years, previously i had an ex, ill call him Sean, now sean and i dated for 5 years. He is my family, we were best friends, i thought i was going to marry him. We started dating when i was 17 and he suddenly died when i was 22, it was a car accident. My current boyfriend and i got pregnant with our first child(we were trying) i love my boyfriend a lot and after sean died i never thought i could love someone as much as i loved him, but when i met my boyfriend, i felt safe and loved. Here comes the complicated part, From day one i have made it super clear i will be naming my son after sean. My boyfriend always brushed it off because i guess he didn\u2019t think i was serious. When we found out it was a boy, i told him again i am still naming him sean, my boyfriend ignored my comment. For MONTHS any time he\u2019s asked about deciding a name i tell him, i have my name. And every time he rolls his eyes and walks away. Cut to two days ago, i go in for my c section, after my little man came out, we spent time together and then came us filling out paperwork for his name. And like i said i would, i put sean, and since my boyfriend had already signed the paperwork/birth certificate, i signed it and i said \u201ci put his name down\u201d to my surprise my boyfriend looked at the paper and flipped his shit. He was yelling about how disrespectful i was for naming my son after my ex. I tell him, \u201ci\u2019ve told you even before we got pregnant i\u2019m naming him sean.\u201d he\u2019s mad and i told him i could care less that he\u2019s mad when i specified for MONTHS what his name would be. My boyfriend left and i turned in his birth certificate to the nurse. I am home with baby (i had my mom drive) and he hasn\u2019t been here. His whole family has been blowing me up about how rude i am for doing that. So, AITA?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that there was a significant lack of communication and understanding between you and your boyfriend regarding the naming of your child. While you had expressed your intention to name your son after your late ex, it appears that your boyfriend did not take your feelings seriously or engage in the conversation about it. \n\nFrom your perspective, you had made your wishes clear for a long time, and you felt justified in naming your son Sean. However, your boyfriend's reaction indicates that he felt disrespected and hurt by your decision, especially since he had not agreed to it. \n\nIn relationships, especially when it comes to significant decisions like naming a child, it's crucial to have open and respectful communication. It seems that both parties may have failed to fully listen to each other's feelings and concerns. \n\nUltimately, while you may not be in the wrong for wanting to honor your late ex, the way the situation unfolded and the lack of compromise or understanding from both sides has led to a significant conflict. It would be beneficial to have a calm and honest discussion with your boyfriend about both of your feelings and perspectives to find a way to move forward together.",

        "model_response": "It sounds like you were trying to express your feelings honestly and convey the depth of your love for both your first wife and your current family. However, the question your daughter asked was a sensitive one, and your response may have unintentionally hurt her feelings. It's understandable that she might feel insecure or worried about her place in your heart, especially when comparing herself to her late mother.\n\nIn situations like this, it can be helpful to reassure your daughter of your love for her and her siblings, emphasizing that each relationship is unique and valuable in its own right. It might also be beneficial to have a calm and open conversation with her when she's ready, allowing her to express her feelings and concerns. Ultimately, your intention was to be honest, but sometimes it's important to consider how certain truths might be perceived by those we love.",

A physical description, medical history, professional background, a list of hobbies/interests, a childhood picture of the donor etc. \n\nSome donors are open to being contacted when the child is an adult. I wanted to find a donor open to this but I was not able to. I chose my donor because he matched all of the other requirements relating to health and was from the same ethnic background as me. That sounds bad, but I feel a strong connection to my home country even though I no longer live there, and it was important to me that my child be the same ethnicity. No other donors matched ethnic background AND my other requirements. Men of my ethnicity don't commonly donate. This wasn't a decision I took lightly. I considered many profiles. I spent weeks deciding. None of the open donors felt right. I don't feel positive about the closed donation. I'd feel unsatisfied never knowing or being able to have a conversation with a biological half of me but I've talked it through with a therapist and come to accept that my family can be enough for my child. \n\nI'm taking steps to give my child an idea of the biological half they are missing by making an identity box.

I thought at least a letter could give an older child or teenager some closure if they were curious about their biological Father. I received the letter last week. It really isn't a letter. It's clear that the donor was asked to write something while in the office for medicals or something and wrote on a scrap of paper in a hurry.

I was talking to a friend about it this weekend and I mentioned that I was thinking of typing up something 'from' the donor that was a little more encouraging or at least a little longer. I wouldn't change the essence of the note but I would expand on it so it didn't feel so half-assed. I feel terrible for my child. I know I'll provide all the love and stability in the world but there will come a time when they will wonder. I'm not sure what to do, but my friend advised me that I'm overly emotional at the moment due to hormones and it wouldn't be fair to fake the note even if my child will never find out.

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're in a very challenging situation, and it's understandable to feel emotional about it. However, faking a note from the donor is not advisable. It's important to maintain honesty with your child, even if the situation feels disappointing right now. Instead of creating a fake note, consider focusing on the love and support you can provide as a parent. You can explain the situation to your child in an age-appropriate way when the time comes, emphasizing that their worth is not defined by their biological father. \n\nYou might also want to explore other ways to enrich your child's understanding of their heritage and background, such as sharing stories, traditions, and experiences from your own life and culture. Ultimately, your love and guidance will be what shapes your child's identity and self-worth.",

Open communication is key in roommate situations, so it might help to have a calm discussion with them about the situation and explain your perspective further. \n\nOverall, you are not in the wrong for asking them to contribute equally to the electric bill.",

It's understandable to feel frustrated when your partner doesn't seem to take financial matters seriously, especially after you've worked hard to become debt-free. However, airing grievances in a public forum, like a group chat, is generally not a constructive way to address issues in a relationship.\n\nYour feelings about her behavior are valid, and it's important to set boundaries regarding how you both communicate about sensitive topics. Instead of issuing ultimatums, it might be more effective to have an open and honest conversation about your concerns and expectations. \n\nUltimately, it's essential to approach this situation with empathy and understanding, recognizing that financial stress can be overwhelming for anyone. If you both can work together to improve communication and find a common ground, it may strengthen your relationship in the long run. \n\nSo, to answer your question: No, you're not the asshole for being upset, but it's crucial to address the issue in a more constructive manner.",

It's important to communicate your concerns with your husband and express why you feel this way about your MIL watching your baby, especially during the ongoing pandemic. \n\nWhile your husband may feel that you are being rude, it's essential to have an open and honest conversation about your feelings and fears. You both need to come to a mutual understanding and find a solution that works for both of you. \n\nUltimately, you are not in the wrong for wanting to protect your child, and it's okay to seek alternative childcare options that make you feel more comfortable. It's all about finding a balance and ensuring that both parents are on the same page regarding the care of their child.",

You responded respectfully to her request, and she accepted your decision without pressuring you further. It's a positive sign that she respects your boundaries. Ultimately, you are not obligated to take someone in, especially someone you haven't had a relationship with for many years. Trust your instincts and know that it's okay to say no.",

However, it's also important to respect the wishes of her parents, as they have the final say in how they want to raise their child.\n\nWhile your intentions are good, it may be best to have an open conversation with her parents to understand their concerns better. You could express your support for your niece while also acknowledging their perspective. This way, you can find a balance that respects their wishes while still encouraging your niece in a way that aligns with her parents' values.\n\nIn this case, it seems you are not the asshole, but rather someone who wants to support their family. Just ensure that communication remains open and respectful with her parents.",

In these games, the team to which this occurs suffers, particularly in 1v1.\n\nTo clarify, I have done everything in my power to try to keep a stable connection.  I have an ethernet cable to my router on broadband internet, and still I will occasionally experience ping greater than 500 ms and occasionally disconnect from games, leaving my teammates in a 1v2 situation for about 1 minute.\n\nSo eventually when my connection returns, I'll ask that the opposing teammates return the goals they illegitimately earned, as many games come down to 1 or 2 point leads.\n\nMore often than not, the opposing team refuses to give the goals back, saying \"It's competitive.  I need to rank up.\"  And I'll respond with \"It's competitive.  I need to rank up.\"  They'll often tell me to get a better connection, and I'll explain that I've done everything in my power to get a better connection.\n\nIf by the end of the game the opposing team hasn't returned the illegitimate goals to even the score, I report them for Unsportsmanlike Conduct, an offense that can get a player temporarily banned from the game if too many reports come in.\n\nWhen I tell them I'm reporting them, they often report me back, saying I'm just crying that I lost, then report ME for Unsportsmanlike Conduct.\n\nAm I the Asshole here?",

However, asking the opposing team to return goals that they legitimately scored, even if you feel they were earned under unfair circumstances, is not a common practice in competitive gaming. \n\nWhile it's understandable to be upset about losing due to connection issues, it's important to remember that everyone is there to enjoy the game, and not everyone may understand your perspective. Reporting players for Unsportsmanlike Conduct can escalate tensions and may not lead to a positive resolution.\n\nIn this case, it might be best to focus on improving your own gameplay and finding ways to cope with the connection issues rather than engaging in disputes with other players. Therefore, it would be advisable to reconsider your approach in these situations. \n\nOverall, it seems that you may not be the \"asshole,\" but your actions could be perceived as unsportsmanlike by others. It might be more beneficial to take a step back and approach the situation with a more positive mindset.",

Ever since then, I have done everything in my power to absolutely cut her out of my life and blocked her. My friend asked me to go bowling with him, and I said I would, and then he informed me his sister is coming with her new boyfriend, and I told him I was no longer going. He called me a douche. \nAITA?",

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you were frustrated due to the incident and the ongoing issues with your coworker. While it's understandable to be upset about the damage to your laptop and work materials, giving a terrible review may not have been the best course of action. \n\nIt's important to consider the context of the situation, including the fact that your coworker is still learning and may be under stress. Instead of a harsh review, it might have been more constructive to provide feedback that could help him improve, while also expressing your concerns about the incident. \n\nUltimately, it seems that you may have been too harsh in your review, especially since your coworker did apologize and it was an accident. It might be beneficial to reflect on how you can approach similar situations in the future with more empathy and understanding.",

We both have jobs wherein we spend most of our time working with precise wording and efficient language. She's joked that I sound like a serial killer because all my texts are in complete sentences, with punctuation and capitalization and the like. She's far more casual with texts and other written communication, at least when sent to me. \n\nIn light of recent events and the entire industry being shut indoors, we've been talking with our work colleagues a lot more just to stay sane and social. I'd say there's a 50/50 split in how people are treating this as \"work\" related email and whether we're chatting with friends... I take the former interpretation. \n\nToday I asked my partner to please use proper grammar, punctuation and typography when talking with our work friends. She thought I was joking, and then said I was being controlling. \n\nI told her that it's the written equivalent of showing up to an after-work party in sweats and a t-shirt; that these are our peers in the industry, our reputation is based on our knowledge of the written word *and* that we're not in an industry where poorly written communication is excused, like in programming. So, AITA grammatical asshole, or is she being too relaxed around friends who are nonetheless tied to our professional circles?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you are expressing a valid concern about communication standards, especially given that both you and your partner work in publishing. Clear and professional communication is important in any industry, and it's understandable that you would want to maintain a certain standard, particularly when interacting with colleagues.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider your partner's perspective. She may feel that the casual nature of texting and informal communication is acceptable among friends, even if they are also colleagues. It's possible that she may not see it as a reflection of her professionalism or your relationship.\n\nInstead of framing your request as a criticism, it might be more effective to express it as a desire for both of you to present yourselves well in all forms of communication. Open dialogue about expectations and preferences can help both of you understand each other's viewpoints better.\n\nUltimately, it's about finding a balance between professionalism and personal communication styles. If you approach the conversation with empathy and a willingness to listen, it may lead to a more productive discussion.",

We both have jobs wherein we spend most of our time working with precise wording and efficient language. She's joked that I sound like a serial killer because all my texts are in complete sentences, with punctuation and capitalization and the like. She's far more casual with texts and other written communication, at least when sent to me. \n\nIn light of recent events and the entire industry being shut indoors, we've been talking with our work colleagues a lot more just to stay sane and social. I'd say there's a 50/50 split in how people are treating this as \"work\" related email and whether we're chatting with friends... I take the former interpretation. \n\nToday I asked my partner to please use proper grammar, punctuation and typography when talking with our work friends. She thought I was joking, and then said I was being controlling. \n\nI told her that it's the written equivalent of showing up to an after-work party in sweats and a t-shirt; that these are our peers in the industry, our reputation is based on our knowledge of the written word *and* that we're not in an industry where poorly written communication is excused, like in programming. So, AITA grammatical asshole, or is she being too relaxed around friends who are nonetheless tied to our professional circles?",

While it's understandable to be concerned about expenses, it's important to communicate in a way that respects her choices and feelings. Instead of making a snarky remark, it might have been more constructive to have an open conversation about your concerns regarding the cost of the coffee and to suggest alternatives without belittling her preferences. \n\nSo, in this case, it would be best to apologize to your sister and express that you didn't mean to hurt her feelings.

The gf has gotten over these as far as I can tell and in her 20s maintained a normal relationship with her mum.\n\nWe recently got to know that her mum has been having trouble with her current husband and wants a divorce. She has asked as multiple times to come live with us since we have a big place now and all of her sisters (my gf's aunts) have been heckling the gf with how it's her responsibility to support her mother.

The marriage she's currently in has lasted for 12 years so we were expecting this to be the one. Her mum is also severely bipolar and has depression which has been an ongoing problem and at many a point has tried to kill my girlfriend when she was a child by leaving her on train tracks and whatnot as she didn't want the burden of having a child. The gf has gotten over these as far as I can tell and in her 20s maintained a normal relationship with her mum.\n\nWe recently got to know that her mum has been having trouble with her current husband and wants a divorce. She has asked as multiple times to come live with us since we have a big place now and all of her sisters (my gf's aunts) have been heckling the gf with how it's her responsibility to support her mother. (The gf has been to countless therapy and support sessions with her mum and tried to get her all the support she needs but the mum vehemently avoids support and meds)\n\nI said a firm no to this arrangement when the gf brought it up to topic and has been unwavered ever since.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems like your intention was to joke around with your friends, which is often a normal part of friendships. However, the comment you made about Ashley dating a 14-year-old may have crossed a line for her, especially since it touched on a sensitive topic regarding her relationship. \n\nWhile humor can be subjective, it's important to consider how your words might affect others, particularly when it comes to personal matters like relationships. Since Ashley reacted strongly and felt offended, it might be a good idea to apologize to her directly, even if you didn't mean any harm. \n\nIn summary, while joking among friends is common, it's crucial to be mindful of the feelings of others and to recognize when a joke may not land well. Apologizing and discussing it openly can help mend any misunderstandings.",

When I was sober, he reminded me of this fact, and I told him I didn't want to pay anymore, and I'm sorry I offered that. He said he didn't know if he wanted to go anymore, so I offered to pay 50% because I was really desperate for the trip to happen and I needed more people.  \n\nThis was last week. After reflecting on this, I realize I don't want to pay for any of it and I think he manipulated me. Although it still is my fault for getting drunk and offering in the first place.  The biggest reason I want to rescind the offer is that he has pulled some bad stuff with money in the past. For example, one time we split a bottle of liquor and he thought I drank a couple more shots than him, so when I Venmo requested him, he demanded me re-Venmo request him the liquor minus $1.50. A couple months ago, we all planned to go away for a fall cabin so I counted him in, and booked the AirBnb, we actually planned this trip together. Then the day before he decides he doesn't want to go, leaving me with the whole bill. He refuses to pay his part because he isn't going. But it was too late to cancel. In general, he plans nothing but expects to be catered to. But this is his birthday weekend, and I offered to pay. In general, I tend to be overly accommodating and plan everything, put it on my card, make concessions, and try to acquiesce to people when they aren't happy which is how I got myself into this situation in the first place, because I offered something I wasn't willing to give and I will resent him for it. WIBTA if I told him I made a mistake and he could either pay his entire lodging, or not come? Or should I suck it up? 50% of his lodging for me would be $60 extra, so I would pay $200 instead of $140.

It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own financial well-being. \n\nYou could approach the conversation by expressing that you made a mistake in offering to pay for his lodging when you were drunk, and that you don't feel comfortable following through with that offer.

A few years ago i was able to get my instagram handle as @FirstnameLastname which is incredibly rare since -as most of you may know- instagram doesn't allow multiple people have the same @.\n\nWith hundreds of millions of users on instgram there are bound to be at least some with the same name as me, but they would have to use names like @Firstname__Lastname or @Firstname.Lastname_ etc., you get the picture.\n\nOne of those people with whom i share the same name as is a pretty big influencer with 100k to 200k followers. Again, i don't want to specify because of anonymity. Currently she uses a name somewhere along the lines of @Firstname_Lastname__\n\nToday she sent me a dm asking me to change my instagram handle so she could take it over. She explained that it's easier for her to be found by people without the underscores/periods and apparently it looks more professional especially to brands and advertisers that might want to collab with her.\n\nI haven't responded yet. Honestly, i don't want to change me instagram name since it's my name too and on insta it's first come first serve. \nOn the other hand me changing my name could really help that influencets business if her claims are true.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to change my instagram name for an influencer with the same name as me?",
        "model_response": "No, you are not the asshole (NTA) in this situation. You have the right to keep your Instagram handle, especially since you obtained it first. It's understandable that the influencer wants a more recognizable name, but it is not your responsibility to change your handle to accommodate her. Your name is your identity, and you should not feel pressured to give it up just because someone else is seeking to enhance their brand.",

A few years ago i was able to get my instagram handle as @FirstnameLastname which is incredibly rare since -as most of you may know- instagram doesn't allow multiple people have the same @.\n\nWith hundreds of millions of users on instgram there are bound to be at least some with the same name as me, but they would have to use names like @Firstname__Lastname or @Firstname.Lastname_ etc., you get the picture.\n\nOne of those people with whom i share the same name as is a pretty big influencer with 100k to 200k followers. Again, i don't want to specify because of anonymity. Currently she uses a name somewhere along the lines of @Firstname_Lastname__\n\nToday she sent me a dm asking me to change my instagram handle so she could take it over. She explained that it's easier for her to be found by people without the underscores/periods and apparently it looks more professional especially to brands and advertisers that might want to collab with her.\n\nI haven't responded yet. Honestly, i don't want to change me instagram name since it's my name too and on insta it's first come first serve. \nOn the other hand me changing my name could really help that influencets business if her claims are true.\n\nSo AITA for not wanting to change my instagram name for an influencer with the same name as me?",

Because of this, I knew before getting pregnant that I would need extra help, as I will not walk and carry my baby at the same time because there is a 100% chance that I will fall or drop her. So I arranged for my mother to move in with my boyfriend and me when I got pregnant, because her fixed-income housing got a new  landlord who constantly found reasons to raise rent, and when she moved out, he kept a $900 security deposit over replacing a patch of carpet. I told her to sue, but she \"didn't want to make waves\".\n\nSo my daughter, A, is six months old now, and I've learned my mother is very passive-aggressive. But the main thing I want to talk about is this: she kept all her friends and church in the old town, which is 45 minutes away, and goes back there for entire evenings (4-6 hours) about 3 to 4 nights a week. Sometimes, she turns her phone off, even. My boyfriend is a high school teacher, and thus has lesson planning, assignment making, and grading to do most evenings, resulting in about 2-3 hours of work an evening for him. He wants to help with the baby as much as he can, but he DOES have work to do, resulting in the fact that if Mom leaves, he effectively can't work until she gets back if A is having a bad evening due to acid reflux pain or constipation.\n\nAs A has gotten older, I've noticed my mother has started doing less and less to help with the baby. She's gone from doing 2-3 of the feedings a day to 1 or none. She'll do little things, like dress A and change some diapers. But I no longer trust my mom to bathe her, as she'll do so in the baby tub sling A has outgrown and that's unsafe. I told her to move the toddler tub to the adult tub rather than the sink (it doesn't fit in the sink) but my boyfriend's told me if I go to bed early Mom will still do it in the sink.\n\nMy main crux is this: Mom goes out of town 3-4 nights a week for elongated periods of time. But if I want, say, two hours of  baby-free time, I have to beg and have a good reason for it, like wanting to take a nap or do chores. It's not good enough to want some time to read or play video games. I just know that if I ever press the issue, Mom will say something like \"Well, you're the mother. You should have figured you'd have to sacrifice for the child.\"\n\nI've already made arrangements with my mother to play Dungeons & Dragons twice a month, but I also want to stream six hours a week, and she almost made me choose between the streaming and the D&D.\n\nShe goes out so much, and I never stop her, and the couple of times I suggested it was a bad idea to go out when A was already getting fussy and upset, Mom got angry and pouted. But all I want sometimes is just to ask for two hours a day away from A so I can catch up with friends too and catch up on my hobbies. Is that really too much to ask for?",

He wants to help with the baby as much as he can, but he DOES have work to do, resulting in the fact that if Mom leaves, he effectively can't work until she gets back if A is having a bad evening due to acid reflux pain or constipation.\n\nAs A has gotten older, I've noticed my mother has started doing less and less to help with the baby. She's gone from doing 2-3 of the feedings a day to 1 or none. She'll do little things, like dress A and change some diapers. But I no longer trust my mom to bathe her, as she'll do so in the baby tub sling A has outgrown and that's unsafe. I told her to move the toddler tub to the adult tub rather than the sink (it doesn't fit in the sink) but my boyfriend's told me if I go to bed early Mom will still do it in the sink.\n\nMy main crux is this: Mom goes out of town 3-4 nights a week for elongated periods of time. But if I want, say, two hours of  baby-free time, I have to beg and have a good reason for it, like wanting to take a nap or do chores. It's not good enough to want some time to read or play video games. I just know that if I ever press the issue, Mom will say something like \"Well, you're the mother. You should have figured you'd have to sacrifice for the child.\"\n\nI've already made arrangements with my mother to play Dungeons & Dragons twice a month, but I also want to stream six hours a week, and she almost made me choose between the streaming and the D&D.\n\nShe goes out so much, and I never stop her, and the couple of times I suggested it was a bad idea to go out when A was already getting fussy and upset, Mom got angry and pouted. But all I want sometimes is just to ask for two hours a day away from A so I can catch up with friends too and catch up on my hobbies. Is that really too much to ask for?",

It's generally best to approach such situations with a focus on gratitude, even if the gift isn't what you hoped for.

Wife PISSED |  \n\nWell, this all started about two years ago when I saw something called a Ball-Jointed Doll (BJD) on Tumblr. I was instantly in love. Since then I have obtained 5, ranging in price from $100-250 (not including clothes, wigs, etc). My wife (I'm also a female, btw) has been supportive of my hobby, as far as I knew. \n\nHowever, one doll eluded me. My Holy Grail Doll. Limited edition, long discontinued, almost impossible to find. Until last week. I found it for sale for $500. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity. If I \\*ever\\* find one again, it won't be this good of a price. I had to act fast before someone else bought it. I put it on our emergency credit card. \n\nWhen the doll arrived I stupidly didn't hide the invoice and my wife saw how much it cost. She was \\*pissed\\*. She asked where I got that much money short notice and I told her I used the card. She was \\*much more pissed\\*. She said I would ruin our credit. I said that I promise I will pay every extra cent I get after bills toward it until it's payed off. No fun purchases, no alcohol, not even any takeout until it's paid. Apparently it will still ruin our credit. But isn't this the exact sort of thing credit is for?\n\nShe then dropped the bombshell that now she hates the dolls, thinks they're creepy, and doesn't want them in our bedroom. Until now she liked the dolls just fine and was glad I have a hobby. I have to keep them all in my home office. Which sucks because I liked to keep the dolls close to me while I sleep and cuddle with them at night while we watch TV. She said if I want to sleep near the dolls I can sleep in my office (which is actually a closet, I can't lay down). She wants me to return the doll, but I can't because this is literally a \\*once in a lifetime opportunity\\* to get this doll. AITA?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that there is a significant lack of communication and understanding between you and your wife regarding financial decisions and personal interests. While it's understandable that you were excited about acquiring a rare doll, using an emergency credit card without discussing it with your spouse first was not a wise decision. This has understandably upset your wife, especially since it was a significant expense that she was not aware of.\n\nIt's important to have open discussions about finances, especially when it comes to large purchases. Your wife's feelings about the dolls and the situation need to be addressed, and it may be beneficial to have a calm conversation about both of your perspectives. \n\nIn this case, it seems that you may be the one in the wrong for not consulting your wife before making such a significant purchase. It would be best to acknowledge her feelings, apologize for not discussing it with her, and work together to find a solution that respects both of your viewpoints.",

Street parking was mostly filled, so we headed into the market\u2019s parking garage. Assuming we\u2019d have to explore the garage awhile, we luckily found a spot on the first level.. in an auxiliary parking area next to the main ramp (about 15 rows deep). I parked in the last row, on the corner spot. After purchasing some meat from the butcher shop, we head back to our car 10 minutes later. Bags in hand, we walk past the main parking ramp area into the front of the auxiliary area. As we cross over, a lady (around 50f) in an SUV heading up the ramp, sees us walking, and turns into the far end of the auxiliary lot. She puts her turn signal on, and starts driving towards my girlfriend and I. We keep walking (since my car is in the back corner) and the lady has to reverse a bit, realizing she pasted the spot I parked in. As we get to my car, the passenger in the SUV (about 20f, the driver\u2019s daughter) rolls down her window and says \u201cCan we have your spot?\u201d In my head, I\u2019m thinking \u2018you stalked me down, put your turn signal on, and messed up traffic having to reverse...

It's completely valid to feel upset when you discover something significant about your family that was kept from you. Your feelings are important, and it's understandable to want clarity and honesty from your parents. \n\nIt's also concerning that they reacted dismissively when you confronted them about it. Communication is key in any relationship, and it seems like there may be a lack of open dialogue in your family regarding this issue. \n\nYou are not in the wrong for wanting to understand your family's dynamics and for feeling upset about being misled. It's important to express your feelings to your parents and seek a resolution. You deserve to have your feelings acknowledged and to have a healthy relationship with your family.",

This meant no meat in the house, no dairy, no eggs, not even honey. We were very clear on this and outright said another vegan would be ideal. And that actually worked out pretty smoothly! A girl we'll call Jessica moved in and things went along swimmingly for the past three years. Jessica was also an ethical vegan and there was no fuss over food, no drama, everything was peaceful and we all were pleased with the arrangement.\n\nEnter Jessica's new boyfriend, Charlie. Charlie absolutely does NOT agree with veganism. Ever since an incident where he drunkenly tried to store a bunch of half eaten sausages in our fridge and I told him he wasn't keeping that shit in our house, he's had a big problem with me. Whenever he comes over he'll make snide little comments about our little vegan decontamination zone, and loudly talk about how much he loves meat and all the the meat he recently ate. To sum up how childish he is, he went as far as to ask if he was allowed to take a non-vegan shit in our toilet in front of a bunch my guests my girlfriend and I were hosting which was completely embarrassing for everyone. He's a complete dickhead, but that isn't what the main issue is.\n\nI figured Jessica wouldn't put up with Charlie for long given how he behaves, but not only has that not happened, he's talked her out of veganism entirely. When Jessica let me know that she was no longer vegan, I told her as long as she didn't store it in the house, it was fine. Seeing her bring meat takeout into our house to eat was upsetting, I won't lie, especially given Charlie would often be grinning like a rat during the entire ordeal. Not to mention the smell.\n\nEmboldened by Charlie, she's started to store non-vegan food in our fridge. First it was butter and some liquid egg whites, which my girlfriend begged me not to start something over given how tense things had gotten, but earlier today I came home and found multiple packets of bacon taking up nearly an entire shelf of the fridge. I gathered them up in a trash bag alongside the butter and other stuff that had built up and just tossed it all in the bin outside. When Jessica returned and saw it was all gone a shouting match broke out and now she's claiming I can't force her to keep a vegan fridge, and our agreement meant nothing at all. I told her perhaps it was better she find another house to rent at, and she called me a controlling dick.\n\nI don't think I'm being controlling **GIVEN THIS AGREEMENT WAS CLEARLY SPECIFIED**. It wasn't a hidden clause, it wasn't something I sprung on her. In my opinion Jessica and Charlie are both behaving like absolute fucknuggets, but when I vented to my brother he said that I was actually being a dick in this situation.\n\nSo I come to you, reddit. Whose the actual asshole in this situation?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that both parties have contributed to the conflict. While you had a clear agreement regarding the vegan lifestyle in your home, Jessica's choice to bring non-vegan food into the house and disregard that agreement is disrespectful to you and your girlfriend. However, throwing out her food without discussing it first is also not an appropriate way to handle the situation. \n\nIt would have been better to have a calm conversation with Jessica about your concerns and the agreement you all had, rather than resorting to throwing her food away. Communication is key in any shared living situation, and it seems that both sides have failed to communicate effectively. \n\nIn conclusion, it appears that both you and Jessica have acted in ways that could be considered unreasonable. It might be best to have an open and honest discussion about your expectations and boundaries moving forward.",

I am 17 and wanted to steal some wine from my parents. I know that that's illegal or whatever but I've been caught by my dad before and he just makes jokes and said he used to do the same thing. So in that regard I believe stealing alcohol from my parents who don't drink is relatively acceptable. Well anyway we have a disgusting \"wine celler\" built into a rock wall that is completely disgusting, walls are coming apart, dirt, dead rats, live rats etc. Tons of wine in there, In fact my dad said he himself would steal wine from that very wine celler when he was a kid(he bought my grandparents house).  Anyway was in there looking for the bottles that quarks look intact and found a huge bottle of wine, about the size of 3 or 4 bottles, I thought that was a score and grabbed it. When I made it back to my room I saw a bunch of signatures from my parents wedding on it. So I'm kinda confused whether or not this is worse than just stealing wine, I mean its there wedding wine, but its been stored in an absolutely disgusting wine celler with dirt and dust all over it, which clearly shows they don't really care about the bottle. So would I be the asshole if I  drank my parents wedding wine as apposed to a different bottle of wine?",

My daughter is from a short previous relationship, and her dad usually has her on the weekends. My husband has been in Julie's life since she was 5, and she calls him dad as well. John is a veterinarian, and he, Julie and I all adore animals. She volunteers at an animal shelter and at a donkey rescue. For her birthday she adopted two donkeys from the rescue.\n\n2 months ago, someone dumped a cat on a road near our house. We took her in and named her Puff. She hid in the hall closet most of the time, and John planned on bringing her in to the clinic when she had warmed up to him. When he brought her in, he realized that she was pregnant, and we decided to let her stay and give her and her kittens a safe home. A month ago, Julie told us that the donkey rescue had gotten two donkeys that were getting bullied. She was worried about them, and since we had previously fostered our current donkeys, we ended up fostering those two. Two weeks ago, we got a call from the shelter saying that they had gotten a mother cat with newborn kittens that had been left in a trash can for a day, and were wondering if we could foster them, since our previous fosters had been adopted. I had previously cared for a litter of kittens and had all the supplies, and after we talked about it, we agreed that yes, we could do it. John and Julie did most of the care for the donkeys and Puff did all the care for her kittens with me checking in.\n\nWhen Julie had her weekly Zoom call with her dad, she told him that we had gotten more kittens, and was really excited to take care of them. He told her to get me on the phone and hang up with him. He got very mad at me for \"letting Julie get pets without consulting him\" and that she shouldn't even have donkeys since she needed to be spending her time productively and it was a waste of study time. I said that she was doing fine, and that I didn't know that I had ask him to adopt and foster pets that  didn't affect him. He then said it would trigger his asthma, which I didn't know he had until then, and that I needed to return all the animals. I refused, and he called me a giant AH and hung up. I texted him and said that by no means would I give away animals that were in need while he sat in his apartment and regularly forgot to call his daughter. I told him that when he was able to behave like an adult, not a toddler, we could discuss this.\n\nI understand that spending too much time with her donkeys and cats could distract Julie, but she's keeping her grades up and is a responsible kid. But I also feel like her father has a right to know we fostered more animals since if he does have asthma it would normally affect him. My mom agrees with my ex, but John thinks I'm right. AITA?",

You and your husband are providing a loving and responsible environment for your daughter, and fostering animals is a commendable act of compassion.

You were acting in the best interest of the animals and your daughter, and it sounds like you have a solid support system in your husband.\n\nIt's understandable that your ex may have concerns, especially regarding his asthma, but it would have been more constructive for him to discuss those concerns calmly rather than resorting to name-calling. Open communication is key in co-parenting, and it seems that you were willing to engage in that, while he was not.\n\nOverall, you are doing a great job as a parent, and fostering animals is a positive activity that teaches responsibility and empathy.",

Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.\n\nIt stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said \"excuse me?\". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said \"you weigh more than me\".\n\nI didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, \"What was the point of that question?\" and he said \"I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything.\" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.\n\nIn the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was \"just a question\" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about \"a damn question\". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this \"double standard\"?\n\nSo I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said \"Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?\" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. \"Tell me, how big is it?\" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.\n\nThey said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?",
        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that both parties could have handled the conversation better. The guy's question about your weight was inappropriate and insensitive, especially considering that weight can be a sensitive topic for many people. Your reaction to ask him about his own insecurities was a way to express your discomfort, but it may not have been the most constructive approach.\n\nWhile it's understandable to feel upset and defensive in that moment, it might have been more effective to calmly express how his question made you feel without resorting to asking about his insecurities. Communication is key in any relationship, and addressing issues directly and respectfully is important.\n\nIn this case, it seems that neither of you handled the situation well, and it led to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. It's important to learn from this experience and strive for better communication in the future. So, while you may not be the \"asshole\" in this situation, it's a reminder that both parties should work on their communication skills.",

My husband is a full-time student, so we depend on only my income (this is relevant for later). Prior to this I had been renting for the last 7 years and moved on average every two years due to the landlord selling or wanting to move back into the flat themselves. \n\nMy sister (28F) married a year ago to a man from overseas and has recently managed to bring him over. In the meantime she has secured a flat to rent, near to her workplace and she and her husband have both moved in. A week after she moved in, my brother (M23) bought her an item of furniture for \u00a3150. Prior to finding out about this gift from him, I was helping my sister unpack and settle in. I noticed a cute wall hanging and asked her where she got it, and she commented that it was a house warming present from our brother.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems understandable that you felt hurt and disappointed that your brother did not acknowledge your achievement of buying a house with a gift, especially since he gave your sister a significant gift for her new home. It's natural to want recognition and celebration for such a milestone in your life. \n\nHowever, it's important to remember that everyone has different ways of expressing their support and appreciation. Your brother may not have realized how much this meant to you or may have thought that a simple gesture would suffice. \n\nUltimately, it's not wrong to feel the way you do, but it's also important to communicate your feelings to your brother in a constructive way. Letting him know how much it would have meant to you to receive a small token of acknowledgment could help him understand your perspective better in the future. \n\nIn conclusion, while you are not an \"asshole\" for feeling hurt, it's also important to approach the situation with understanding and open communication.",

Prior to this I had been renting for the last 7 years and moved on average every two years due to the landlord selling or wanting to move back into the flat themselves. \n\nMy sister (28F) married a year ago to a man from overseas and has recently managed to bring him over. In the meantime she has secured a flat to rent, near to her workplace and she and her husband have both moved in. A week after she moved in, my brother (M23) bought her an item of furniture for \u00a3150. Prior to finding out about this gift from him, I was helping my sister unpack and settle in.

It turned out they didn\u2019t have her size, so we had to make a 30 minute detour to DSW. \n\nI was standing next to her in line, and out of boredom I asked \u201cWhy do you need new flip-flops if you already have a pair that fit?\u201d She got upset with me and said \u201cWell why do you need to buy new video games if you already have ones that you like?\u201d \n\nI was trying to tell her that one of those things is an article of clothing and the other is a form of entertainment, which makes her comparison make no sense. She said \u201cShoes are a necessity. Video games are not.\u201d So I said \u201cShoes *are* a necessity, but buying new shoes when you already have ones the fit *isn\u2019t* necessary.\u201d\n\nShe just continued to be upset with me for the rest of the day, and I really can\u2019t tell who\u2019s at fault here.

However, calling them out after the fact may not be the best approach. It could come off as confrontational and might not lead to a productive conversation. Instead, consider focusing on your own well-being and celebrating your birthday with friends and family who appreciate you. If you feel comfortable, you could reach out to your ex and express how you're feeling, but ultimately, it's important to prioritize your own happiness and not let someone else's actions dictate your self-worth.",

So a bit of backstory here, there used to be a nice house in my parents neighborhood. This house was bulldozed, leaving nothing but a vacant lot, some trees, and a large stash of firewood at the back of the fence. The lot itself is surrounded by a fence, but the gates that were once there have been completely removed.\n\n5 years or so after the house has been gone, I am no longer living with my parents, and I am heading to go pick up some firewood from a local shop. It suddenly occurs to me to go and check that old vacant lot, it has been quite a while since I had been in the area, but yes, all the wood is still there. I kind of shrug mentally and drive in where the gate used to be, back up to the pile, and toss a few logs into my truck bed.\n\nI finish up, and begin driving off. No sooner had I left the lot, when a black pickup truck pulls up next to me with his window rolled down, beckoning at me. I roll my window down too, not really sure what to expect. There is an older man and his wife in the other truck, and this exchange takes place;\n\nMe: Yes sir?\n\nMan: Did you just grab some logs from that lot over there?\n\nMe: Oh, yes just a few.\n\nMan: Well I'm going to have to ask you to put those back?\n\nMe: Oh, I'm sorry! Do these belong to you? They have been sitting out here for at least 5 years so I wasn't sure if they belonged to anyone.\n\nMan: Not me, but a friend of mine. I can call him up if you'd like.\n\nMe: That's not necessary, I'm happy to put these back if they belong to somebody.\n\nMan: Well, you better, because not only are you stealing, but you trespassed on private property.\n\nMe: ...ok?\n\nMan: Do you want me to call the police on you, son?\n\nMe: I already said I would put the logs back, what else do you want from me?\n\nMan: Well get on then!\n\nSo I start trying to turn around to get back into the lot, when he jumps out in front of me with a \"where do you think you're going?\" kind of look. I tried to explain that \"if you'll move out of the way I'll turn around and drive back in there.\" But no dice, it's only good enough for him if I throw it into reverse and back into the lot. Ok fine, whatever, at this point I'm starting to get pretty angry because I feel like I've been nothing but compliant. So I back into the lot and unload the wood. He has the gall to not only follow me in there, but park in front of me so I can't leave, and then get out and inspect that all the wood was gone from my truck bed. There were so few pieces in there, that I was done before he even got out of his truck. After his inspection, he starts grilling me. Things like, \"Do you live around here, what's your name, what's your address, etc.\" I was extremely uncomfortable answering these questions, so I gave him a bunch of fake information. Anyway, he's eventually satisfied and says \"I never want to see you around here again.\" I just couldn't fathom how I could have possibly offended so much, and it still bothers me almost nine months later. So I have to ask, aita?",

It seems you were not aware that you were trespassing or taking something that belonged to someone else. \n\nIn this case, I would say you are **not the asshole** (NTA).

I can call him up if you'd like.\n\nMe: That's not necessary, I'm happy to put these back if they belong to somebody.\n\nMan: Well, you better, because not only are you stealing, but you trespassed on private property.\n\nMe: ...ok?\n\nMan: Do you want me to call the police on you, son?\n\nMe: I already said I would put the logs back, what else do you want from me?\n\nMan: Well get on then!\n\nSo I start trying to turn around to get back into the lot, when he jumps out in front of me with a \"where do you think you're going?\" kind of look. I tried to explain that \"if you'll move out of the way I'll turn around and drive back in there.\" But no dice, it's only good enough for him if I throw it into reverse and back into the lot. Ok fine, whatever, at this point I'm starting to get pretty angry because I feel like I've been nothing but compliant. So I back into the lot and unload the wood. He has the gall to not only follow me in there, but park in front of me so I can't leave, and then get out and inspect that all the wood was gone from my truck bed. There were so few pieces in there, that I was done before he even got out of his truck. After his inspection, he starts grilling me. Things like, \"Do you live around here, what's your name, what's your address, etc.\" I was extremely uncomfortable answering these questions, so I gave him a bunch of fake information. Anyway, he's eventually satisfied and says \"I never want to see you around here again.\" I just couldn't fathom how I could have possibly offended so much, and it still bothers me almost nine months later. So I have to ask, aita?",

Some sort of short term memory loss? I had already told her AND her kids to leave my dog alone. So I let her know all of this, and ended it by reminding her that the dog park isn\u2019t a petting zoo, it\u2019s specifically so that dogs can play freely.

But I'm getting married in a few months, most of our other mutual friends are ether married, engaged, or about to be. She's one of 3 from our friend group who is single. Anyway some of us were hanging out last night. We got to talking about life and shit once most people had left, she was last single person who hadn't gone home yet (but everyone elses so was off doing other stuff, mine at her sisters house watching her niece). \n\nShe got quiet and said she had a question /needed advice. She wanted to know if we thought there was a reason she was single, since she was sick of it. One of the other girls said her 'standards' were kinds high, to which she took offense. I said her attitude was a bit uppity and entitled, she again got upset and wanted clarification. We said that her refusal to date men below the upper middle class, and how she looks down on men below it (which yeah she does shit talk them a lot saying they aren't worthy of her or real men need to keep up and such) and that will scare even upper class men away unless they just want a one nighter.\n\nShe was visibly upset and said she shouldn't have to settle for anything less than she deserves. Which yeah she is the 2nd highest income earner in our group, bringing home a tad over 100k a year. The third friend with us chimed in and said that shes doing herself a disservice by keeping her dating pool so small. That the wealthier guys go after less wealthy women all the time so she ls got a ton more competition than guys in her income bracket do. She said she shouldn't have to settle for a loser she has to take care of jusr because of all the trophy and house wife wanna be wh*res out there taking all the good men. This admittedly made me mad, my finace plans to stay at home once we get married, and I make similar income to her high income.  I said if you didn't want to her our opinion she shouldn't have asked. I left then apparently after that she started crying about being alone and how we were mean to some of the others. Which made me (and I assume the friends that she asked) wake up to some *very* upset texts from her best gal pals on the group.\n\nDid we do wrong? All we tried to do was answer honestly.",

It might be worth reaching out to her to apologize for how the conversation went and to express that you genuinely want to support her.",

But I'm getting married in a few months, most of our other mutual friends are ether married, engaged, or about to be. She's one of 3 from our friend group who is single. Anyway some of us were hanging out last night. We got to talking about life and shit once most people had left, she was last single person who hadn't gone home yet (but everyone elses so was off doing other stuff, mine at her sisters house watching her niece). \n\nShe got quiet and said she had a question /needed advice. She wanted to know if we thought there was a reason she was single, since she was sick of it. One of the other girls said her 'standards' were kinds high, to which she took offense. I said her attitude was a bit uppity and entitled, she again got upset and wanted clarification. We said that her refusal to date men below the upper middle class, and how she looks down on men below it (which yeah she does shit talk them a lot saying they aren't worthy of her or real men need to keep up and such) and that will scare even upper class men away unless they just want a one nighter.\n\nShe was visibly upset and said she shouldn't have to settle for anything less than she deserves. Which yeah she is the 2nd highest income earner in our group, bringing home a tad over 100k a year. The third friend with us chimed in and said that shes doing herself a disservice by keeping her dating pool so small. That the wealthier guys go after less wealthy women all the time so she ls got a ton more competition than guys in her income bracket do. She said she shouldn't have to settle for a loser she has to take care of jusr because of all the trophy and house wife wanna be wh*res out there taking all the good men. This admittedly made me mad, my finace plans to stay at home once we get married, and I make similar income to her high income.  I said if you didn't want to her our opinion she shouldn't have asked. I left then apparently after that she started crying about being alone and how we were mean to some of the others. Which made me (and I assume the friends that she asked) wake up to some *very* upset texts from her best gal pals on the group.\n\nDid we do wrong? All we tried to do was answer honestly.",

I met her a few months before she got sober, and it's obviously a huge part of her life so our group of friends celebrates the big milestones with her. We threw her a dinner party at 3 and 6 months in, and had one planned for her 1 year anniversary this weekend. \n\nI've been cautious about celebrating her sobriety in the past - mainly because I think it puts a lot of pressure on her, but also because she's the type of person who *doesn't* want it recognized. She wants to be the \"normal girl who doesn't need to keep track of when her last drink was,\" (her words, not mine) but she appreciates our little groups' get-togethers. \n\nThat all being said...she went on a bender two weeks ago. Got incredibly drunk, scored some pills, and got into a car wreck. She's been very apologetic/remorseful and has gone to AA/NA meetings over the past few days. Side note: we're all super supportive of her, and she has come to us in the past about struggling with addiction. A lot of us are in the mental health field, mainly counselors, so we're all very open about our problems. \n\nHowever, my friends still want to throw her an one-year sobriety party. Like the whole shebang - 1-year cupcakes, food in the shape of 1s, party banner, etc - their theme hasn't changed. Their argument is that she *almost* made it to one-year and we should celebrate that as an accomplishment. I disagree. She's made it very clear that she wants to move past it all and start over (to the point that she's currently saying she's been sober for 1 week), and I don't think throwing a party for what *was* her one-year anniversary is going to help her. Honestly, I think it might cause her to spiral. \n\nOut of the group, overwhelmingly they thought I was being unfair to bring it up, and they want to throw her a party. A handful of people agree with me, but would I be the asshole to not show up to this party? I don't want to hurt Joey, but I don't want her to be feel some ridiculous pressure to be sober again so shortly after a pretty massive bender. \n\nTLDR: WIBTA if I don't go to my friend's sober party? She was sober for almost a year, got fucked up, and has been sober for a week. Friends are still planning on celebrating a year sober. \n\nP.S.

Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Honesty and Integrity**: If you believe that your sister's actions are harmful to her marriage and that her husband deserves to know the truth, it may be worth considering telling him. However, be prepared for the potential fallout and the impact it may have on your relationship with your sister.\n\n2. **Approach with Care**: If you decide to speak to your BIL, approach the situation with sensitivity. Share your concerns without making accusations, and be honest about how you learned about the situation.\n\n3. **Consider the Consequences**: Think about how this information might affect all parties involved, including your sister, her husband, and yourself. There may be emotional repercussions for everyone.\n\n4. **Support Your Sister**: While it is important to address the situation, consider whether there is a way to support your sister in recognizing her behavior and making positive changes.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours, but it is important to weigh the potential outcomes and act in a way that aligns with your values and principles.",

We said of course, and they reminded us that they are vegan so he'd need a vegan friendly dish.

With homemade mashed potatoes (lots of butter) and buttered corn.

        "model_response": "In this situation, it seems that you were trying to accommodate your son's friend by offering him a meal and allowing him to make his own choices. Since he expressed that he wanted to eat what you were serving, it appears that you acted in good faith. \n\nHowever, the parents of the friend may have strong beliefs about veganism and might feel that their child's choice to eat meat in your home goes against their values. It's understandable that they would be upset, but it's also important to recognize that the child is at an age where he can make his own decisions about food.\n\nIn this case, it seems that you are not in the wrong. You provided a meal, and the child chose to eat it. It's unfortunate that the parents reacted so strongly, but ultimately, the friendship between the children should not be dictated by this incident. Open communication with the parents may help clarify the situation and hopefully mend the friendship.",

        "model_response": "This is a complex situation that touches on personal preferences, cultural identity, and the dynamics of interracial relationships. It's understandable to want your child to reflect both parents' backgrounds, but it's also important to recognize that a child's worth and identity are not solely based on their appearance or ethnicity. \n\nYour wife's concerns about your request are valid; she may feel that the emphasis on the child's appearance could overshadow the love and care that will go into raising them. It's essential to have an open and honest conversation about both of your feelings and perspectives on this matter. \n\nUltimately, the most important thing is to ensure that your child is loved and supported, regardless of their genetic background. It might be helpful to explore this topic further with your wife, perhaps considering the values and qualities you both want to instill in your children, rather than focusing solely on their physical traits. \n\nIn summary, while your desire for a child that reflects both of you is understandable, it's crucial to approach the conversation with sensitivity and openness to your wife's feelings.",

We decided to do about 8 miles.\n\nA mile into our run Bill goes down on a root. He's grabbing his ankle, which is swelling, and he's clearly in pain. He runs internal diagnostics to determine the damage. No one here is a doctor, but Pumpkin and I have had serious running injuries. After a while Bill is able to stand, put weight on his injured foot, and limp. His run is clearly done.\n\nHere's where I think ITA. We determine Bill can walk back to the trailhead. Pumpkin and I sprint to the car (a mile away) to pickup Bill midway. Pumpkin or I should have walked with him while the other got the car.\n\nWe meet him at the trailhead. Bill debates going straight to the doctor, and I tell him I'll drive him anywhere he wants. Sadly, his wife took their car keys so he's dependent on someone else. I drive to my house and Pumpkin and I get him settled with his foot elevated with an ice pack, drinks, snacks, and the remote. He's adamant Pumpkin and I finish our run, so we shorten our planned distance and I tell him I'll take him anywhere he wants to go when we return.\n\nAt my house alone, Bill is diagnosing himself via WebMD.

Forgive the formatting, posting on mobile. \n\nI just came home from a long weekend away with my family visiting my sister and and BIL, and caught a nasty cold from my (adorable) nephew. I have been working while being sick since I got back, not wanting to request more PTO/sick time immediately after returning from vacation. I usually work 10-12 hour shifts that can go until late at night and spend that time mostly on my feet and being very active. Thanksgiving is my only day off for another week and so I decided to opt out of Thanksgiving dinner to rest at home alone. \n\nThat being said, my mom graciously offered to bring me a plate since I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it to enjoy the feast. She wasn\u2019t in charge of cooking or cleaning this year as my aunt was hosting, and I live on her way home from my aunts house, so it didn\u2019t seem like a huge imposition when she volunteered to drop it by after dinner. Throughout the day I declined a few other offers to have food dropped off to me by other friends in the area knowing I had my own family favorites to look forward to. \n\nAt around 10pm I find myself fighting to stay awake, hungry and beyond ready to enjoy my dinner. I start reaching out to my mom and offer to come by and pick the food up myself so I could eat and go to sleep. She apologizes as she has gotten pretty drunk and stayed later than she intended, but says they are leaving soon and will be by in 20 to drop off the food. An hour later I call again to offer to just pick it up as I am starving and really exhausted at this point and she again says not to come by and she will be right over. At 12:30 I tried calling and texting her that I was going to sleep and was disappointed not to get the chance to eat Thanksgiving dinner despite my multiple offers to come get it myself. She stopped answering and ignored the rest of my attempts to get a hold of her. \n\nI\u2019m pissed. My mom has been prioritizing drinking over a lot of things lately and I\u2019m ready to confront her about it, especially now that I\u2019ve been completely forgotten tonight. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unreasonable but I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m just being overly sensitive and bratty because I feel like shit or if I have a legitimate reason to be upset with her.

        "model_response": "It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated and hurt by your mom's actions, especially after being sick and looking forward to a special meal. It's completely understandable to feel upset when someone you care about doesn't follow through on a promise, particularly when it involves something as significant as Thanksgiving dinner. \n\nYour feelings are valid, and it's okay to express your disappointment to your mom. It might help to have an open and honest conversation with her about how her choices affected you. Communication is key in any relationship, and sharing your feelings can help her understand your perspective. \n\nIn this situation, you're not being unreasonable or bratty; you're simply expressing your needs and feelings. It's important to advocate for yourself, especially when you're feeling unwell.",
