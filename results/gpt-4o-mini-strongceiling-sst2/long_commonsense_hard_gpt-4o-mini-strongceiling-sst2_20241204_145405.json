I said, \u201csure, you can help me oil these mushrooms.\u201d Before I could go into more detail he grabs a mushroom and tosses it into a pan of oil (long story short: there is way more oil than needed for the mushrooms, it was leftover from roasting garlic and I plan to save most of it for other uses throughout the week). I yelp, \u201cwoah, not like that! Just put a little from the spoon and use your hand to rub it around, they don\u2019t need to be completely submerged.\u201d He got upset and said I was being rude for not just taking the help he was offering.

I\u2019m so used to ordering for myself that I ordered just one Pepsi for me, and nothing for her (we shared a cheese pizza). \r\n\r\nWe\u2019re eating and talking and she said she was thirsty, so I grabbed my coffee mug from my bag and filled it with sink water from the bathroom. It\u2019s not like I gave her toilet water ffs, and I went out of my way to pay for this hotel for us. \r\n\r\nShe went off on me and then took an Uber back home. All for sink water. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nEdit - canteen* not mug\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for blasting music to try and ruin my neighbor's party and berating him in front of a bunch of kids | About a year ago, I got this new neighbor next door who makes my family's life a living hell. For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking to split the check on a 2nd date? | Matched a girl through online dating. We have pretty good chemistry through our texts and I take her out to a comedy show, pay for it, no problem. We have a great time.\r\n\r\nNext week I ask if she wants to meet up, she suggests happy hour and picks a time and day. I pick the place. She tells me how she spent 4th of July in the Hamptons at that her multimillionaire friend covered most of it and then paid for a crazy expensive party where there were celebrities. Also talks about how she's going to Europe. I talk about how I've been struggling for the past couple years but finally found a decent career that I'm happy in but I want to leverage that into something more so I can have money. We're having a good time just talking, but she has to go. I call for the check. \r\n\r\nServer says there's a discount for cash instead of credit. Date asks me if I have cash on hand. I say no, I only have my card, and did she want to split. Well, it was if I insulted her with every name under the sun. She refused to look at me after that and just wanted to get out of there. I immediately apologized and said I didn't know how that she felt so strongly about it. She told me she didn't even know what to say, and that no one had ever asked her that question before. It soured the whole evening and probably ruined any chances of a third date.\r\n\r\nI really didn't think it was that big a deal, I get that it's courtship, but I figured since she had told me earlier about not liking people who are spoiled/sensitive and the wealth disparity... I just didn't think much of it at the time. \r\n\r\nSome friends have told me that I'm fine and they've had 2nd dates where they split, and I have before. But other friends have told me that absolutely not I should always be paying until it turns into a relationship.\r\n\r\nSo, am I the asshole?\"\"\"",

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life.

He wants me to apologize for hurting his feelings | I\u2019ve been stressing hard about my disability being renewed (I\u2019ve been on it for like 10 years already, vomiting syndrome, seizures and chronic urticaria) and when I found out it was approved I jokingly said \u201cit\u2019s all downhill from here\u201d, implying nothing better could happen to me today.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats.

My siblings can shower in the gym at school and my dad can maybe look into getting a tankless heater for the house. I mean, the way I feel is this is just finger pointing at me when they know I've had medicallly diagnosed issues and a prescribed method of treatment to help me cope. If I were to have a septic wound that needed to be washed every morning, no one woukd be screaming at me with choice words like \"lazy fat pig.\" I'm just taking a shower for the love of God.\r\n\r\nBut I need to be more open minded in my thinking so I'm asking here. Am I the asshole for taking long showers before I go to bed?",

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

It's only 4 of us, and we rotate houses each session.

(Weird to me, but everyone else seems ok with it) \r\n\r\nThey're also insisting that everyone who wants to see the baby has to get a flu and TDAP shot beforehand. And since we'll be playing at his house we're included in this.\r\n\r\nSo here's the shocking twist: I don't want to do any of that. At this point I'm perfectly fine in not having contact with him or his child for the 6+ months they stated. I don't want to endanger the child, but I also dont necessarily feel that everyone should have to work around his kid for the next 6 months for what will likely amount to <12 sessions total.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously.

This was 7 years ago.\r\n\r\n* The second stillbirth, we'll call her \"Sarah\", happened at 6 months. This was 4 years ago.\r\n\r\nRegardless, she has had 4 successful births, currently aged 1,3,6, and 9. They're a happy family together, and have not forgotten their unborn children. They held memorial services for both, for the immediate family. She has gotten tattoos of their footprints on their own feet, and can't wait to get to heaven to finally meet them.\r\n\r\nMy brother feels similarly, but that's mostly because of his choice to support and comfort her through both losses. They're his daughters too, and could've moved on, but it hit his wife hard so he went through that journey with her.\r\n\r\nAs far as my dad goes, I'm positive he was not impacted so harshly. He was definitely there to console them in their loss, and was briefly sad that he wouldn't get to meet new granddaughters. But, he made years of happy memories of his 5 living grandchildren.\r\n\r\nMy SIL wrote this in the draft of his obituary:\r\n\r\n> Ralph is preceded in death by his father Tony and granddaughter\u2019s Dianne and Sarah.\r\n\r\nMy SIL has been very open about her losses on Facebook, and everyone in her circles knows about them and knows they're truly lost family to her. However, my dad's circles and my SIL's circles do not overlap so neatly. There's people that know my dad that have never met my SIL.\r\n\r\nMy worry is that the sentence will be a negative conversation starter that pulls the focus away from remembering my father: \"oh my goodness, Ralph had two granddaughters that passed away?!\". \r\n\r\nWIBTA if I tell her to remove the mention of her stillborn daughters from my dad's obituary?\"\"\"",

This was 7 years ago.\r\n\r\n* The second stillbirth, we'll call her \"Sarah\", happened at 6 months. This was 4 years ago.\r\n\r\nRegardless, she has had 4 successful births, currently aged 1,3,6, and 9. They're a happy family together, and have not forgotten their unborn children. They held memorial services for both, for the immediate family. She has gotten tattoos of their footprints on their own feet, and can't wait to get to heaven to finally meet them.\r\n\r\nMy brother feels similarly, but that's mostly because of his choice to support and comfort her through both losses. They're his daughters too, and could've moved on, but it hit his wife hard so he went through that journey with her.\r\n\r\nAs far as my dad goes, I'm positive he was not impacted so harshly. He was definitely there to console them in their loss, and was briefly sad that he wouldn't get to meet new granddaughters. But, he made years of happy memories of his 5 living grandchildren.\r\n\r\nMy SIL wrote this in the draft of his obituary:\r\n\r\n> Ralph is preceded in death by his father Tony and granddaughter\u2019s Dianne and Sarah.\r\n\r\nMy SIL has been very open about her losses on Facebook, and everyone in her circles knows about them and knows they're truly lost family to her. However, my dad's circles and my SIL's circles do not overlap so neatly. There's people that know my dad that have never met my SIL.\r\n\r\nMy worry is that the sentence will be a negative conversation starter that pulls the focus away from remembering my father: \"oh my goodness, Ralph had two granddaughters that passed away?!\". \r\n\r\nWIBTA if I tell her to remove the mention of her stillborn daughters from my dad's obituary?",

In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

My mom invited my ex as well which I have no problem with.

They took our 3 children (7f,5f and 3m) and placed them with my mom. Shortly after this my wife and I split up and she moved in with another guy. He was an old friend of mine so my kids know him but can\u2019t see him because of our situation. \r\nMy middle daughter still won\u2019t accept this and thinks once we get through this my ex and I will get back together. It\u2019s like she thinks the judge is not letting us be together. So I\u2019m having almost daily talks with my daughter trying to get her to understand that her mom and I will not get back together and her mom has a new boyfriend(fianc\u00e9)\r\nBack in October my middle daughter had her 5th birthday at a skate rink.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"WIBTA for restricting my daughter\u2019s phone usage for, among other things, constantly talking to her dad? | No disclaimers, no apologies, let\u2019s get right into it. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m one of those parents who got their 10 year old a phone mainly for stuff like getting a hold of her after school in case pickup plans change and other emergencies. \r\n\r\nHer dad and I are separated and I am married to her stepdad which is all fine, it\u2019s amicable.

Like, slept in bed with him til she was about 7, wouldn\u2019t sleep on her own at his place unless he camped out on the floor, that kind of stuff. It got better between 8 years old and now, but then I got her the phone and while I have no problem her using it to keep in touch with him I\u2019m concerned about the over-attachment again. \r\n\r\nI totally get that it\u2019s normal for kids of separated parents to have separation anxiety and all kinds of fixation issues and what not but I\u2019m concerned that getting the phone has made it worse again.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life.

In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends.

My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\".

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

I yelp, \u201cwoah, not like that! Just put a little from the spoon and use your hand to rub it around, they don\u2019t need to be completely submerged.\u201d He got upset and said I was being rude for not just taking the help he was offering.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday.

Sorry, but we are using this room now. We will be done in about 45mins though.\u201d \r\nThe guy got visibly upset and argued saying his name is on the reservation list, so we have to leave. I told him to go and get one of the Office Assistants if he wanted to and that I refused to leave. He mumbled something that sounded like  \u201cbitch\u201d and slammed the door and walked away. \r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the people I was studying with basically called me an asshole and said we should had just given up the room. I think the situation just made her uncomfortable. She\u2019s not confrontational. \r\n\r\nBUT \r\n1)the dude was over 3hrs late to his reservation \r\n2)it\u2019s a GROUP study space. It\u2019s meant for groups to work on material together. And this guy was alone. \r\n3)he was a jerk \r\n\r\nAITA?",

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic!

It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for sharing a girl's creepy fan-fiction? | In my group of friends a girl has had a crush on me for quite a long time, it was cute at first but it steadily got more and more annoying as she didn't seem to understand that I was not interested at all.

Lo and behold she's not stopped and has just continued.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic!

In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for refusing to get my husband food from the store? | I\u2019m going to make this short, mainly because it\u2019s fucking ridiculous this is even an issue. I went grocery shopping this morning and spent over $100 on groceries for the week. My household consists of myself (24f), my husband (26m), and our daughter (4mo). I don\u2019t buy many snacks because my husband works and I\u2019m a SAHM, and he usually only eats one large helping of dinner while he\u2019s at work since he sleeps in as long as possible. So the fridge has food in it. \r\n\r\nFast forwards to just now, I was sort of hungry, but not enough to cook a whole meal and decided I would go get some sushi as a snack from the store. It costs like $7, I was going to hold me until I start dinner probably around 7 or so. I announced my plans as I picked up my keys, and my husband asked if I would bring him back something also. I said sure and asked what he wanted. He asked if I would bring back hot wings and an oven pizza. I told him to pick something else, something smaller, and he demanded to know why. I said bc I just spent $100+ on groceries: if he wants a meal there\u2019s food in the kitchen. I\u2019m just going to grand a small snack - my item will be $7, his would be $15+, and it\u2019s not like we\u2019re rolling in money - we live paycheck to paycheck, and there\u2019s been several times where we have no food at the end of the month while we wait for the next payday. \r\n\r\nAnyway, he gets pissy and says he doesn\u2019t say that to me when he goes to pick up McDonald\u2019s or something for us. I said yes, but in that situation we\u2019re getting the same amount of food for the same amount of money, when there\u2019s no other food around. We have food, I\u2019m just getting a snack. I can get pizza and hot wings the next time I go grocery shopping, though. \r\n\r\nWell he goes off. Starts saying that I\u2019m calling him fat and I\u2019m being a hypocrite and it\u2019s okay for me to go get myself sushi and he can\u2019t get what he wanted. I tried to re-explain but it\u2019s like he was only hearing what he wanted to hear. I got so fed up I just walked outside to cool off. I feel like I was being fair, am I the asshole here?\"\"\"",

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

Our mom died when I was young, our dad left, and we were raised by our grandmother. A year ago, she was diagnosed with cancer and Mary moved back in to care for her. \r\n\r\nTwo weeks ago, she passed away. Mary had called me a few days beforehand to say that she was in decline, so I took a leave of absence from work and returned home. When she died, I agreed to stay in the country to help plan the funeral and handle legalities with her estate.\r\n\r\nIn our grandma's will, her inheritance was divided very evenly. She had left the house to Mary, which we all agreed was more than fair. Although the house was Mary's, she left the divvying up of the furniture to my sisters and I. We agreed to go through the house and put post-it's with our name on it on the furniture we wanted. More than one post-it, we would duke it out amongst the two who wanted it. No post-its, it'd be sold at an estate sale. \r\n\r\nI live a fairly nomadic life, so I didn't want much. Since my sisters were claiming pretty much everything else, I decided the two things I wanted was a brooch and a small lamp. The lamp was first in my grandma's nursery, then my mom's, then Kylie and Nora's. \r\n\r\nBy the time we had finished stickying everything we wanted, we realized that all 8 of us had claimed the lamp. I told my sisters that it was only fair that I take it, since I only wanted the two things, while the rest of them had essentially taken the whole house. Kylie felt that since it had been \"hers\" most recently, it should be hers, but Nora felt she had a similar claim. Jane didn't \"want much\" so she felt deserving of the lamp. Elle wanted it in lieu of a wedding gift from our grandma (who was too poor to buy her one), and Ruth wanted it as furnishing for her new place. Mary thought she deserved it for taking care of gran, and Jill felt it was fair that it go in \\*her\\* daughter's room. \r\n\r\nI told Kylie, who also wanted the brooch, that she could have it if I got the lamp. She refused. It dissolved into a huge spat, so I went outside to calm down. When I came back in, they had agreed to \"table the discussion.\" We all went to go home, but I sat in my car for a minute and cried about the lamp. It was stupid to cry over, but I was feeling really upset in general at my gran's death and was furious that my sisters hadn't allowed me the one thing. I decided to get it anyways.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously.

This is important for later. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nMy SO goes to college, and carpools with a friend. Their school is quite far (45 min. on a good day) so they carpool. I sometimes go and pick up my SO if need be, or if we have plans later. The days I go pick her up ends up being me out of the house from around 2 in the afternoon to 7 or 8,\r\n\r\nHere's the issue. My SO's friend is usually good when it comes to driving her back home, but the times she doesn't are always due to rather petty things and very short notice. Sometimes she'll leave early and tell my SO at the last second, forcing me to ditch the time I had for schoolwork and fucking up my schedule as well as my SO's.\r\n\r\nThen there's today. I've been working on an important project for one of my classes, and my SO texts me that her friend can't take her home because she's doing her mother's hair at noon, when both their classes end around 4.

This is important for later. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nMy SO goes to college, and carpools with a friend. Their school is quite far (45 min. on a good day) so they carpool. I sometimes go and pick up my SO if need be, or if we have plans later. The days I go pick her up ends up being me out of the house from around 2 in the afternoon to 7 or 8,\r\n\r\nHere's the issue. My SO's friend is usually good when it comes to driving her back home, but the times she doesn't are always due to rather petty things and very short notice.

I've been working on an important project for one of my classes, and my SO texts me that her friend can't take her home because she's doing her mother's hair at noon, when both their classes end around 4.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE!

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for demanding that my girlfriend (long distance relationship) takes the time to write me a message after she'd a very busy day? | My girlfriend and I live in a long distance relationship, as in several countries apart. She's at med school and currently in the practical part of her education. She has to work six days a week from morning till evening, including night shifts. Additionally, she has to prepare for very important exams very soon. The time she doesn't spend working, she spends studying or sleeping to recover. It gives us very little time to communicate, and communication is very important to me. She doesn't like the current situation, but she wants to do well in her education.\r\n\r\nI expect her to at least write me a message in the morning and the evening, just to hear something from her. It also eases my own mind, because if I don't hear anything I can stay at ease and have (for example) trouble sleeping. This is not because I am worried if I don't get messages, but because I get angry and I'm also a bit insecure. I think it should be possible for her to spend a minimum of one minute in the morning and the evening to write a few words. I normally, tend to write her regularly throughout her work days, just about thinks going on, but if she doesn't manage to write those one of those messages I just talked about, I'll stay silent until something comes from her. I also let her in an indirect/passive-aggressive way know that I am not happy with her lack of communication. Admittedly, part of my goal is to make her feel bad and to change her behaviour. I want to support her in any way possible through her difficult time, but I just can't help it if this minimum is not fulfilled. I know it pressures her and I feel bad, but I also feel the need to vent my frustration. She knows that it is important to me, but currently she has neither time or the energy to discuss it in length. I know she is trying, just as I am trying not to vent my frustration. Besides from that issue I have no problem with her being busy, I appreciate what she is doing and I let her know that.\r\n\r\nAITA for demanding that time from her and for being vocal about my frustration, even though I know she is trying?\"\"\"",

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my door unlocked against my roommates' wishes? | For context, me and my roommates live in a small three bedroom house in Tucson,AZ. My bedroom is the master bedroom and I pay what they both pay in rent combined for it. My room was built as an add on to the house, so there's a door to our backyard in it. About a year ago, shortly after I moved in to the room, I was thinking about how convenient it would be to be able to come in through that door. A lot of times, my hands are super full coming into the house, it's the easier door to open, and the bed is right there when you walk in so I can drop everything if it's heavy. I am also one of those people who always forgets something inside, so locking the door is always a pain because a lot of times I'm going to have to unlock it immediately anyway.\r\n\r\nThen I realized, why not leave it unlocked? How much does a locked door actually deter a burglar? I did some quick research and while consensus is generally in favor of locking your doors, there are some people that leave their doors unlocked. I didn't see it any different really as leaving a spare key somewhere nearby. I've been burgled before, while I was sleeping and with a dog in the house, so I know that if a burglar really want's to get in, one small deadbolt isn't going to stop them. I decided to start leaving the door unlocked, and I didn't tell my roommates because in my opinion there wasn't anything to tell.\r\n\r\nNow, one year later, my roommates find out about it. They think there's no reason to leave the door unlocked and they ask me to start locking it. I explained everything above to them, but they did not agree. One of my roommates then proceeded to enter my room every day to lock it from the inside against my wishes. I'm a big proponent of not getting into fights with your roommates, so I let it slide for a while hoping that maybe he would give up, or maybe I would get used to it. But every time I had to pee, or the wind was whipping around outside, and the smart lock on our front door wouldn't open and I had to re-pair my phone to it, I grew a little bit more resentful. One of my roommates has a pet, even though that's against our lease, but I take that risk. And he's moving out in June!\r\n\r\nA couple of days ago, I locked my room's interior door from the inside so that if my roommate wanted to lock it, he would have to go outside and use his key. This started a rehashing of the whole fight, and now we're stuck. My argument is that the thing they are scared of is not any more likely whether or not I leave my door unlocked, at least not in a reasonable way. I am taking the same risk as them, yet I am not scared. The idea came up that I should pay if any of their stuff gets stolen, but then I am providing them with free insurance since there's probably not going to be a way to know whether my door being locked would have deterred the thief. Their argument is that they are not getting any benefit from this, and thus should not have to take any risk no matter how minute it is.\r\n\r\nAITA?\"\"\"",

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for buying my wife a gift that \"she didn't need\" for her birthday? | My wife had her guitar stolen before a gig four months ago. She had a backup so it never affected her work but she said she would save up for a replacement of comparable quality to that one because it meant a lot to her.\r\n\r\nI thought I'd be a good husband and today, for her birthday, I gave her a guitar. I bought it two weeks ago and kept it hidden until this morning. I don't know much about guitars so I tried to get something a similar color to the one that was stolen and let the shop employee guide the rest of my purchase. I spent $600, her guitar that was stolen was $1800.\r\n\r\nShe got upset at me for \"spending \\[our\\] money foolishly\". She said she'll never use it because it's not the same or even close to what she had or has in other guitars. This sounds like NTA territory but she followed it up with \"you should never buy someone a musical instrument because it's a personal decision\" which made me question whether I made the right choice at all. \r\n\r\nShe told me she appreciated my attempt to help but this was money spent that will go to no use, and if I wanted to do this again, talk to her beforehand. She said we could have pooled our money and got a replacement for what she had stolen.\r\n\r\nI don't know anything about guitars or even instruments in general. If it wasn't a good guitar I'm sure she could upgrade it or something to be good, right? It's a pretty piece of wood with strings on it, isn't that what determines the price?

At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"...

I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE!

Basically, it sucks for her majorly. Due to some of her own behaviors, and his better lawyers, it's looking like she'll get very little from the divorce and was ordered separate and needed a place to live. She has a very young daughter and I suspect might be pregnant (with her husband's kid, but I think she might want to get an abortion so I've not brought it up). I own a house with more than enough space, so I was happy to open my house to her. I told her to stay as long as she needed and I'll help with my niece no problem. \r\n\r\nIt's been a few months now, and it was going well, but recently I just feel like I want my own space back. She's rarely underfoot and they keep to their own area of the house, and she cleans up after herself, cooks for me occasionally, so no problems there. But I just am a little tired of living with a child and my sister and I just want to get on with my normal life. She is also still in contact with her husband, so every once and a while I have to listen to her argue with him which makes me feel anxious in my own home.

Basically, it sucks for her majorly. Due to some of her own behaviors, and his better lawyers, it's looking like she'll get very little from the divorce and was ordered separate and needed a place to live. She has a very young daughter and I suspect might be pregnant (with her husband's kid, but I think she might want to get an abortion so I've not brought it up). I own a house with more than enough space, so I was happy to open my house to her. I told her to stay as long as she needed and I'll help with my niece no problem. \r\n\r\nIt's been a few months now, and it was going well, but recently I just feel like I want my own space back. She's rarely underfoot and they keep to their own area of the house, and she cleans up after herself, cooks for me occasionally, so no problems there. But I just am a little tired of living with a child and my sister and I just want to get on with my normal life. She is also still in contact with her husband, so every once and a while I have to listen to her argue with him which makes me feel anxious in my own home. She also works from home very often so sometimes I just feel like I can't do what I want to do because I know she's there.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find.

I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for mentioning that I had a chronic toothache while my wife was in labor? | I\u2019m posting this from my wife\u2019s account and both perspectives are included. I, the husband, am asking if I\u2019m the asshole. \r\n\r\nThis is a topic we\u2019ve been debating for the past almost two years now. It\u2019d be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. \r\n\r\nMy perspective (husband):\r\n\r\nMy wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. Over the prior couple months I had started developing an intermittent toothache. About two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, I probably ate something delicious. \r\n\r\nAfter eating something delicious, I can\u2019t quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. I\u2019m talking sharp, eye-watering pain. Her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. \r\n\r\nOver the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  I didn\u2019t want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. \r\n\r\nOnce they arrived, to my surprise I was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. That with a couple Excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife\u2019s contractions started to pick up. \r\n\r\nAm I the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?\r\n\r\nWife\u2019s perspective:\r\n\r\nMy husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. It kept getting worse, and every time he\u2019d complain I\u2019d say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. \r\n\r\nSo as he mentioned, as I was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. Granted I wasn\u2019t in terrible pain, but for a few hours while I was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. \r\n\r\nI did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but I had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment I felt I should be focusing on. \r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to also mention it wasn\u2019t just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours. \r\n\r\nHe is a great father and husband, but is he also the asshole?\"\"\"",

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic!

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

My two sisters and brother try to help as much as possible,  but she'll refuse us (which leaves everything to her once we leave).

We are all open for suggestions but her delivery can be harsh.\r\n\r\nThe  cherry on the top for every holiday is that she'll start to get  stressed as the day progresses.  Each time, she announces in a loud voice, \"Next year, we are going out to eat! I am not cooking again!\" And every year we agree and lock her down to a promise that is always broken by her.\r\n\r\nThis year, my siblings and I decided Christmas will be at one of our houses with Chinese food.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself.

In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously.

I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my brother and his friends in the forest? | \r\nThis happened 1 year ago. It's the reason my mom says I'm not invited on vacations anymore. My friends say I wasn't in the wrong but I want an outside perspective \r\n\r\nMy older brother (30M) called me (28F) and asked if I could drive him to our parent's cabin to stay for a week together. I was thrilled bc my brother and I have never been close and this trip could bring us closer \r\n\r\nI drive my brother and I up to the cabin. It's a 3 hour drive. We were there for maybe 2 hours and I hear a knock on the door. My brother invited the worship group from his church (6 men) w/o my knowledge.

I talked to my brother about how I thought this trip was about quality time between us, He assured me we would spend time together.\r\n\r\nThe first 1-4 days my brother spends it w/ his worship team practicing songs w/ breaks to pray. They practice from 6AM to nearly midnight. It was loud and kept me up all night even with ear plugs. I was getting 3 hrs sleep max. I asked my brother if they could be quiet after 10PM. The lack of sleep was messing with my mental health. He said he would see what he \"and God could do\". \r\n\r\nSome backstory: I was diagnosed w/ bipolar disorder 1 six years ago. It's been a long road to recovery.I manage my bp1 through therapy, meds, support system, and a strict sleep schedule. Not enough sleep triggers manic episodes for me.

I just wanted to spend time w/my brother so I relented. It was a 2hr hike to the peak of the mountain. My brother tells me that we were camping there tonight. He didn't say anything about that before we left. I told him I can't b/c I don't have a sleeping bag or my meds. He said there's an extra sleeping bag, and one missed dose wouldn't kill me. I was angry at this point. My thoughts were racing. I started rage-crying, \"I need my meds.\"\r\nHe yelled at me to stop being crazy and ruining the trip.We argued back and forth. I told him I'm taking my meds no matter what. He threw the sleeping bag on the ground and sat w/his group to eat dinner. \r\n\r\nWhen everyone went to sleep, I stole my brother's flashlight and GPS (there was a 2nd GPS in the group), and I hiked all the way back to the cabin. I packed up all my shit and drove the 3 hour trip home. When I got home, I took my meds then slept for 12 hours. When I woke up I had a dozen missed calls from my parents. Yelling how I stranded my brother and the worship team in the forest. They were disappointed and angry. My brother told my parents my complaining and \"bipolar\" ruined the trip.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\".

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends.

My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously.

Since he cooks so much at work he doesn\u2019t often cook at home. This week however he felt inspired to cook so asked my mom if he could try making a dish for everyone tonight. \r\n\r\nHe made this lamb dish with roasted potatoes and other vegetables and it was really good and he plated it up all nice before serving but he let the plates sit out for a while on the counter before serving.

That didn\u2019t happen because after he plated them up he was doing something else and then a bit of cleaning so after only a couple minutes of eating the dishes were getting cold. When we asked if they were ready when we saw them sitting out he said not to sit down yet.  \r\n\r\nI went to microwave mine for a bit to warm it back up.

Since he cooks so much at work he doesn\u2019t often cook at home. This week however he felt inspired to cook so asked my mom if he could try making a dish for everyone tonight. \r\n\r\nHe made this lamb dish with roasted potatoes and other vegetables and it was really good and he plated it up all nice before serving but he let the plates sit out for a while on the counter before serving. I think as a chef he\u2019s used to just plating a dish at his restaurant he works at and having a waiter take it away hot to the table very soon after. That didn\u2019t happen because after he plated them up he was doing something else and then a bit of cleaning so after only a couple minutes of eating the dishes were getting cold. When we asked if they were ready when we saw them sitting out he said not to sit down yet.  \r\n\r\nI went to microwave mine for a bit to warm it back up. When I came back to the table my brother looked pretty pissed off. He asked if something was wrong with dinner. I told him that no it was really great it had just gotten cool and I\u2019m a slow eater so I needed to warm it back up. He didn\u2019t say anything the rest of dinner. I told him again I liked it and he mumbled a thanks. \r\n\r\nMy parents agreed with me that the dish had gone cold. They had just eaten it cold though. Should I have? AITA here?",

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

He doesn\u2019t have anyone else to take him last minute and it takes a while to reschedule. I\u2019m not sure how I can see him so soon after this, WIBTA if I back out?",

In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for creating a DnD Group after I was kicked out of my old group and destroying a friendship? | In my home town, there's one dedicated group for Dungeons and Dragons for teenagers. I, (16 M), joined a running campaign. The campaign was extremely serious and grim dark. I created a human bard who's a big nerd for music theory who's overly friendly, but also quick to anger. I have a nasty habit of getting caught in the moment and saying stupid shit. That cultivated to a head when we were fighting the BBEG and I called it a 'big dumb shit face' using Vicious Mockery (A spell where you insult a foe and it hurts) and it kills. Me and one other guy out of a group of eight are the only ones laughing. \r\n\r\nWe'll call the guy who laughed 'Chris'. He becomes important later. Both Chris and I and friends with the DM. Throughout the campaign I did a few, kind of minor jokey things. The DM pulls me aside and is like, 'you fucker, this was my big moment and you made a stupid joke.' Keep in mind, we are all awkward and hormonal teenagers.\r\n\r\nDespite what I felt, at the time, triumphant, I now felt like shit. I apologized, I took my stuff and left. I actually in retrospect feel bad. Later the DM sends me a strawpoll over Discord showing the majority of the group decided to kick me. One voted not to kick me. Obviously I'm angry, but it's not like I didn't expect it. I send a good bye message to the group. I kinda get ghosted by the group, which made me feel worse. I was a mess for a bit because I felt like an idiot and was confused, but then I decided to stop pitying myself and resolved to make my own campaign with my own players, one that wasn't as grim dark, one that was serious but also had a lot of room for comedy and jokes. I create a world and invite five people who were not involved with the previous campaign and to my surprise, everyone joins. This is where it gets bad.\r\n\r\nI run session zero and hey, these new players are pretty good, they roleplay and interact. On the cusp of starting the actual first session, Chris wants to join my campaign. I asked him like 'Hey, aren't you still apart of DM's campaign?\" He was like, \"Yeah\"... in something I probably shouldn't of done in retrospect. I said yes. New group mates love Chris and his char. This is when things went from bad to worse. \r\n\r\nI receive a message from old DM and he is *furious*. He said that I was so shit at Dungeons and Dragons that I needed to steal his players to have any chance. Apparently Chris jokingly shit-talked old DM's campaign and gave old DM the heads up that he was leaving to join mine. \r\n\r\nNow, supposedly, over Discord messages between Chris and old DM, they argued over me and now hate each other and I'm being used as the arguing point.

When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic!

In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA because I turned down a dinner offer at my son\u2019s apartment because their place is too hot? | I\u2019m making a throwaway to keep things private.\r\n\r\nMy son and his wife moved into their new apartment last year and have tried inviting us for dinner a few times since then to have us come and see their new place. Every time unfortunately I\u2019ve had work or some other commitment come up due to which I haven\u2019t been able to make it. They seem to mind it a lot because apparently I\u2019ve visited my daughter and her husband\u2019s place a few times even though they live twice as far away, though I\u2019ve explained to them clearly I have never turned down their offers willingly and it\u2019s always been an unfortunate incident getting in the way, while my daughter\u2019s invites have worked out because nothing ever got in the way.\r\n\r\nSo coming to the point, I invited them last week over at our place for dinner. They quickly jumped on us and said if we\u2019re inviting them for dinner, that means we\u2019re free, so we should go over for dinner at their place instead. I turned it down because it\u2019s too hot and I didn\u2019t want to be inside an apartment on a hot day. They\u2019ve been completely ignoring my texts since then and didn\u2019t show up at the dinner I invited them to. Later I heard from other family members that they\u2019re really hurt and they\u2019ve decided they\u2019ll never invite me ever again. I don\u2019t know why this blew up so much. I just didn\u2019t want to be at their place on a hot day is all, but I did want to see them and hang out with them. I think they\u2019re over reacting to the situation, but obviously the rest of the family thinks I\u2019m at fault. \r\n\r\nSo reddit, do you think I\u2019m the asshole in the situation?

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive.

At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday.

I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE!

At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving.

Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue.

I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"...

I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend.

I (28M) really don't feel like an asshole but I have nothing to base that on.\r\n\r\nI was at a buddies bachelor party weekend in Denver, CO. Saturday night rolls around and \\~1-2am a group of us decide to go to a strip club. I had never been to one before and wanted to check it out. About 6 of us head on in and quickly hit up the bar after giving the place a once over. Pretty quickly a couple of the guys found a girl to give the bachelor a private dance. The two of them head off to the back while the rest of us start hanging out around the stage.\r\n\r\nAt this point I am just hanging out and enjoying the show. A few girls come on and off the stage and I was even throwing some money around (really not much). Eventually I am standing up near the stage and a girl comes up to me and says \"I have been looking all over for you!\". Now, I know this girl wasn't looking anywhere for me, it felt like a panhandler throwing a routine at me. Not really knowing what else to do I just tell her \"No thanks\" thinking she'd leave me alone. I really didn't want any private attention and was thinking our group would be heading out anytime as soon as the bachelor was done with his dance.\r\n\r\nHer response to this was \"Why would you say 'no thanks' when I haven't offered you anything?\". I tried to explain that I am just here for a buddies bachelor party and just wasn't interested in anything. Keep in mind the club was extremely loud and it was very difficult to hear anything.

Really not knowing what to do or why a stripper is mad at me I just start apologizing and try to tell her again that I am just here to support a friend and wasn't interested in a private dance. Again she tells me, getting more and more aggressive that she hadn't offered me a dance and it was extremely rude to assume that she would.\r\n\r\nAt this point I literally put my hands up in surrender, apologize again, and tell her this is the first time I have ever been to a strip club.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find.

I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself.

We\u2019ll call my girlfriend L and her sister J. We moved because J would always have people over , and we wanted the privacy of no roommates. Once we moved, someone took our spot there.\r\n\r\nFast forward from when we left (May 2018) to January 1st, 2020. J fucked her roommates over by not paying the rent for two months, as our landlords just accepted cash. For two months, she took the $3000  spent it on \u201cbills\u201d that her sister isn\u2019t even sure about. After ruining her relationship with her roommates, She got the money from family to pay the rent off, and asked L and I to move in until the end of January.

She only comes here to sleep after she parties with her friends. Our house is essentially a hangover den.\r\n\r\nWhat makes matters worse is because of the current situation, the job she had a chance at has shut down. So shes not even looking for work. But that isn\u2019t stopping her from going out every other night, to parties, where she doesn\u2019t even think that if she was to get sick from being stupid, it would affect us as well.\r\n\r\nL wants her out, but is really conflicted because it\u2019s her sister. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be happy about me speaking to J about it, even though she also wants J out.  I don\u2019t want to seem like a dick, but it\u2019s at the point where I might just take the risk of L being mad at me.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\".

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends.

My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

Just put a little from the spoon and use your hand to rub it around, they don\u2019t need to be completely submerged.\u201d He got upset and said I was being rude for not just taking the help he was offering.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously.

About four months ago I noticed she stopped wearing her engagement ring and I asked her why. She said she didn't want to lose it so she keeps it in a jewellery box hidden away for special occasions. I didn't press further.\r\n\r\nI found out a month ago that while this is technically true, she has told me she doesn't know where the jewellery box is. She doesn't have much jewellery so she told me it's literally just a ring box, not one of those bigger fixtures you might think when you think about jewellery boxes. She said she was actively looking for it.\r\n\r\nA week ago it got to a heated discussion about the ring where I tell her I'm disappointed she's lost it. She tells me she did not in fact lose it, but misplaced it. To me, that means the same thing. She said she hasn't had time to look for it but knows she didn't lose it (???).\r\n\r\nNow I bring it up every day, asking her if she found the ring. The answer is always no. She is getting mad at me and getting her parents to put pressure on me to drop it. She \"doesn't want to be reminded of it\". If I was in her shoes and I lost literally the most expensive thing I own, I'd be frantically looking for it, not taking this laissez-faire approach. I mean, I wouldn't have lost it anyways: I would have known where it is at any moment on any day. You don't just lose something that's $4000, right? The longer it takes for her to find it, the less likely she's going to find it, right?\r\n\r\nAm I the asshole here?\"\"\"",

About four months ago I noticed she stopped wearing her engagement ring and I asked her why. She said she didn't want to lose it so she keeps it in a jewellery box hidden away for special occasions. I didn't press further.\r\n\r\nI found out a month ago that while this is technically true, she has told me she doesn't know where the jewellery box is. She doesn't have much jewellery so she told me it's literally just a ring box, not one of those bigger fixtures you might think when you think about jewellery boxes. She said she was actively looking for it.\r\n\r\nA week ago it got to a heated discussion about the ring where I tell her I'm disappointed she's lost it. She tells me she did not in fact lose it, but misplaced it. To me, that means the same thing. She said she hasn't had time to look for it but knows she didn't lose it (???).\r\n\r\nNow I bring it up every day, asking her if she found the ring. The answer is always no. She is getting mad at me and getting her parents to put pressure on me to drop it. She \"doesn't want to be reminded of it\". If I was in her shoes and I lost literally the most expensive thing I own, I'd be frantically looking for it, not taking this laissez-faire approach. I mean, I wouldn't have lost it anyways: I would have known where it is at any moment on any day. You don't just lose something that's $4000, right? The longer it takes for her to find it, the less likely she's going to find it, right?\r\n\r\nAm I the asshole here?",

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good.

In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends.

My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them.

We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

I'm a newly sober alcoholic. | \r\nI am a woman in my late 20s and I've very recently started to realize I've got a binge drinking problem...\r\n\r\nI've very recently started going to a therapist, and she is also referring me to a recovery program that I'll be starting soon. But as of now, I'm really early on in this whole process and I've only told my husband, who had been the only person to really notice I had a problem.\r\n\r\nLast week was my sister's wedding. We aren't too close, she's almost ten years older than me. I wasn't in the bridal party, she had a small party of her friends. I wasn't upset or insulted by that.\r\n\r\nAt the wedding, there was an open bar, champagne at every table, and pretty much everyone was drinking. \r\n\r\nI got myself a glass of water and I felt like I stood out a little for not drinking. A couple people offered me drinks, my brother, my uncle and aunt, even family of the groom who were mingling with us. I'd always decline politely, \"no thanks\" \"I'm good for now\" Nobody asked any questions for a while. \r\n\r\nUntil it was time for speeches and toasts. \r\n\r\nMy aunt was pouring out champagne for everyone and I was like \"no thanks\" and she asked \"Oh why not?\"\r\n\r\nI didn't want to say much so I was just like \"oh just for personal reasons, I'm not drinking right now\" and she was like \"Are you...\" And wiggled her eyebrows in a way that seemed to mean something.\r\n\r\nI had no fucking idea what she was getting at. The anxious part of my brain was filling that empty space with questions like \"Are you an alcoholic?\" \"Are you afraid you're gonna binge drink if you start drinking?\" Etc...\r\n\r\nI know how dumb it sounds that I didn't realize, all I can say is that none of my friends or close family have kids, I don't think much about what signals a pregnancy. But I've had a couple people in my life get sober because of drinking problems. So that's the connection that I saw as obvious.\r\n\r\nI just froze up and shrugged awkwardly.\r\n\r\nI didn't think any more about it until later. My husband came to me and said that people were congratulating him on the baby.

I'm a newly sober alcoholic. | \r\nI am a woman in my late 20s and I've very recently started to realize I've got a binge drinking problem...\r\n\r\nI've very recently started going to a therapist, and she is also referring me to a recovery program that I'll be starting soon. But as of now, I'm really early on in this whole process and I've only told my husband, who had been the only person to really notice I had a problem.\r\n\r\nLast week was my sister's wedding. We aren't too close, she's almost ten years older than me. I wasn't in the bridal party, she had a small party of her friends. I wasn't upset or insulted by that.\r\n\r\nAt the wedding, there was an open bar, champagne at every table, and pretty much everyone was drinking. \r\n\r\nI got myself a glass of water and I felt like I stood out a little for not drinking. A couple people offered me drinks, my brother, my uncle and aunt, even family of the groom who were mingling with us. I'd always decline politely, \"no thanks\" \"I'm good for now\" Nobody asked any questions for a while. \r\n\r\nUntil it was time for speeches and toasts. \r\n\r\nMy aunt was pouring out champagne for everyone and I was like \"no thanks\" and she asked \"Oh why not?\"\r\n\r\nI didn't want to say much so I was just like \"oh just for personal reasons, I'm not drinking right now\" and she was like \"Are you...\" And wiggled her eyebrows in a way that seemed to mean something.\r\n\r\nI had no fucking idea what she was getting at. The anxious part of my brain was filling that empty space with questions like \"Are you an alcoholic?\" \"Are you afraid you're gonna binge drink if you start drinking?\" Etc...\r\n\r\nI know how dumb it sounds that I didn't realize, all I can say is that none of my friends or close family have kids, I don't think much about what signals a pregnancy. But I've had a couple people in my life get sober because of drinking problems. So that's the connection that I saw as obvious.\r\n\r\nI just froze up and shrugged awkwardly.\r\n\r\nI didn't think any more about it until later. My husband came to me and said that people were congratulating him on the baby. I was like \"what the fuck, what baby?\" And he was like \"yeah I asked the same thing, apparently your aunt is going around saying we're expecting. I was baffled.\r\n\r\nIt was only later that i understood.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find.

I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving.

So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"...

Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive.

After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic!

It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them.

We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive.

After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

She was also at the prayer service even though she is not as Christian as I am and normally was not there. She just happened to know the student who passed away.

My ex girlfriend also sent me a message telling me that she found it hurtful and that she would prefer that I not speak about her again, at least not when she is present.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

The person who I was dealing with apparently did not know either, and he ordered the wrong phone (S20 ultra) because he saw it came in black.

Sadly this was something my mother didn't seem to understand, and she was very upset when I told her I would not be going. She was very angry with me and went on about how all my many cousins and other family members were coming, it's so selfish of me not to attend my grandfather's funeral, I'm just being cheap, she planned the funeral closer to Christmas so I could be there for the holidays and now I'm ruining her Christmas, and the like.

I'm very sad that I wasn't able to go to the funeral, and I'd like to think my reasoning for not going is justified, but I can't help but wonder should I have tried to do more to get there? Should I have just paid the mortgage late, or maybe return some Christmas present I'd already bought by then, and does it make me an asshole that I didn't?

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously.

I told him what his uncle told me and I was pretty upset that he thought he couldn\u2019t confide in me. \r\n\r\nJack started to cry and basically started ranting about how I \u201cabandoned\u201d him and his Mom when he was young and how I\u2019ve \u201calways preferred Daren\u201d to him and that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t tell me because he feels like he doesn\u2019t matter to me. \r\n\r\nI tried to explain myself and I said that I understand that I\u2019ve been a shitty father sometimes but I love him and I don\u2019t care that he\u2019s gay. \r\n\r\nHe told me that he didn\u2019t know if he was ever going to tell me because I\u2019m an \u201casshole\u201d and I have no right to get upset about not knowing something about him after I abandoned him so long ago. He then hung up on me. \r\n\r\nI haven\u2019t told my wife or Daren what\u2019s happened and I don\u2019t want to until I work through all this and gain some perspectives on what happened. \r\n\r\nSo AITA for getting upset?",

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats.

In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends.

My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday.

I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do.

In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not taking my husband's dog to the vet? | My husband and I have 3 kids together 9M, 3F & a 2 month old male.\r\n\r\nAbout a week before our baby turned a month old my husband got a call from a friend that his dog had puppies and he was looking to find a home for them & asked him if he was interested in any. My husband asked what breed were the dogs (pitbull & bulldog mix) and how old they were (5 months). My husband has ALWAYS wanted a pitbull or bulldog.\r\n\r\n Husband asked me if I was okay with him bringing a dog home. I told him it was up to him whatever he decided to do. I made it very clear to him that if he decided to bring a dog home, that it was his responsibility at all times. I told him he was going to be the one to do everything for the dog. He agreed. He brought a dog home.  He asked me the favor of taking the dog out during the day while he was at work. I hesitantly agreed.\r\n\r\n The dog of course gives me trouble. He pulls on the leash and doesn't want to do his business outside. I'm having a hard time not getting upset because when the hell did I decide to sign up for this.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I ask my husband when is he taking the dog to the vet because he needs his shots and I don't want an unvaccinated dog near our kids. He asks me If I can take him. I say no & proceed to tell him I was already doing him too much of a favor by taking the dog out during the day while he's at work. He says okay.\r\n\r\n Well, our baby is now 2 1/2 months old and my husband has not taken the dog to the vet yet. We find out the dog has worms because you can see them in his poop. I once again tell him he needs to take his dog to the vet and he once again asks me to take him. I explained that he needs to understand that his dog is not leash trained, he pulls himself everytime I take him outside, and I'm not going to be looking like an idiot out in public with a baby, 4 year old, 9 year old and an untrained dog pulling on his leash, just to do him the favor of taking him to the vet. He said that I'm being a jerk because I know that he doesn't have a set work schedule. I tell him it's not my problem and he should've thought about that before he brought the dog home. He doesn't say anything after that and that's that.\r\n\r\n Today I saw my kids playing with the dog and they were letting him lick them. I tell them to stop letting the dog lick them because the dog has worms and I've seen him licking his private parts and don't want them contracting anything. Especially because the 4 yr old has the habit of putting her hands in her mouth constantly. My husband hears this, gets mad, puts the dog in his kennel and just snaps.

When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much.

We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before.

I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic!

He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life.

I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends.

He obviously had the wrong number cause he was addressing a woman (I\u2019m a dude). He went on for like 5 minutes, but it was really sweet - he really loves this woman and will do anything to be with her, will give up everything, and so on. I felt a little bad watching it  cause it was so personal, but I was curious \u2013 you know you would have watched it too. My thought was that I should let him know he\u2019s got the wrong number or username or whatever, but I was driving and just thought I\u2019d deal with it later. Ok, so I forgot about it and later that night I check my phone and I have like 6 more messages from the dude and they are all these personal, lovestruck messages - the guys no Casanova but it\u2019s charming and I\u2019m sure any woman would appreciate his flattery. But I\u2019m hanging with some friends and I just didn\u2019t want to deal with this weird ass situation then, so I let it be and thought maybe he\u2019d realize the number was wrong.\r\n\r\nNope. Three more messages the next morning, and he\u2019s still pouring his heart out how he wants to be with her, showing he got his hair braided for her, etc. But at this point I\u2019m like shit, now this guy has left all these messages and he must know they\u2019ve been viewed and now if I tell him it\u2019s the wrong number he\u2019ll 1) probably be mortified at himself for sending all those very vulnerable, personal messages and 2) probably be pissed that some dick saw them all and didn\u2019t bother to tell him it was the wrong number. I was probably overthinking all of this, so I did decided to do nothing and hope he just figures out he\u2019s got the wrong girl (guy).\r\n\r\nFast forward a month - I\u2019m still getting messages from said dude, and now I feel like I absolutely can\u2019t break the guy's heart that all his love has been for naught and yeah, I knew he had the wrong number all along.

            "input": "AITA for not telling some lovestruck dude he has the wrong number? | So I guess I\u2019ve had WhatsApp on my phone for a while but totally forgot I even had the app. About a month ago I noticed a notification pop up for it, opened the app and there was a video message from some random guy. He obviously had the wrong number cause he was addressing a woman (I\u2019m a dude). He went on for like 5 minutes, but it was really sweet - he really loves this woman and will do anything to be with her, will give up everything, and so on. I felt a little bad watching it  cause it was so personal, but I was curious \u2013 you know you would have watched it too. My thought was that I should let him know he\u2019s got the wrong number or username or whatever, but I was driving and just thought I\u2019d deal with it later. Ok, so I forgot about it and later that night I check my phone and I have like 6 more messages from the dude and they are all these personal, lovestruck messages - the guys no Casanova but it\u2019s charming and I\u2019m sure any woman would appreciate his flattery. But I\u2019m hanging with some friends and I just didn\u2019t want to deal with this weird ass situation then, so I let it be and thought maybe he\u2019d realize the number was wrong.\r\n\r\nNope. Three more messages the next morning, and he\u2019s still pouring his heart out how he wants to be with her, showing he got his hair braided for her, etc. But at this point I\u2019m like shit, now this guy has left all these messages and he must know they\u2019ve been viewed and now if I tell him it\u2019s the wrong number he\u2019ll 1) probably be mortified at himself for sending all those very vulnerable, personal messages and 2) probably be pissed that some dick saw them all and didn\u2019t bother to tell him it was the wrong number. I was probably overthinking all of this, so I did decided to do nothing and hope he just figures out he\u2019s got the wrong girl (guy).\r\n\r\nFast forward a month - I\u2019m still getting messages from said dude, and now I feel like I absolutely can\u2019t break the guy's heart that all his love has been for naught and yeah, I knew he had the wrong number all along.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for forcing my friend to buy me an uber to get home? | Ok so first of all, this is a throwaway account because whatever.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo my friend group hangs out a lot and in order to save gas/time/money, we end up carpooling a lot. Today my friend, Carly, wanted to take her younger sister, Annie, to see animals at a farm. This seemed like a spur of the moment thing since they called me to tell me to get ready about 10 minutes before they showed up at my apartment. My friend, Stan, was already in the front passenger seat and Carly was driving with her younger sister Annie in the backseat, so I got in the seat across from her.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nWe end up at the farm, but we don't stay long due to the lack of animals and just things to do in general. Afterwards, we hang out some more at a park and we get food. Along the way, we end up picking up another friend, John, but we all decide to go home. Stan, John, and I all live relatively close so Carly was going to drop us off at home in the order of me, Stan, and John. \r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nShe pulls into my apartment complex and stops a few feet before my building. I ask her to pull up closer so I wouldn't have to walk as far and she would have to move up anyways in order to turn around and leave. She refuses. So I put my foot down and refuse to get out because she was being difficult. This stalemate lasts a few minutes before Carly decides to leave... with me still in the car. She ultimately decided that I \"had my chance\" and that she was going to drop off Stan and John then she was going to go home. She said that I could get out at one of their houses and find a way home from there. But due to unrelated reasons, I wouldn't be able to get home if I did, so I stayed in the car and watched them leave one by one until it's just me Carly and Annie left in the car.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nCarly drives back to her house like she said she would, with me still in her backseat. She asks me how I plan to get home. I ask her to just drive me back home and offer her gas money. She says that she was serious when she told me that she was not going to drive back to my neighborhood. I remind her that every time that I have given her a ride, I have made sure that she actually makes it home safely. So she says that she'll order an uber for me, I offer to pay but she eventually decides that she doesn't want to accept it. 5 minutes later, the uber arrives and takes me home but since then, the whole situation has been running through my mind.

In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic!

It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic!

It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

I work from home and have a two bedroom apartment where one acts as an office. I wanted to live alone for that reason.\r\n\r\nI'm new to living in the city but I have friends here so I'm social/know people who live around me. After settling in for a few months, I decided to start dating. I met a guy on a dating app and we hit it off. We've been seeing each other for the last three going on four months. The first month, we hung out in public pretty exclusively ie restaurants, bars, festivals/events, etc. He's walked me back to my building and I walked myself inside.\r\n\r\nA month and a half in, we started to hang out at his apartment. Both after we went out and then as dates. We'd just watch movies, eat takeout, talk, etc.\r\n\r\nHe has a roommate: a friend from college. His roommate frequently hangs out with a friend who lives in their building and we typically try to schedule apartment dates then.

I work from home and have a two bedroom apartment where one acts as an office. I wanted to live alone for that reason.\r\n\r\nI'm new to living in the city but I have friends here so I'm social/know people who live around me. After settling in for a few months, I decided to start dating. I met a guy on a dating app and we hit it off. We've been seeing each other for the last three going on four months. The first month, we hung out in public pretty exclusively ie restaurants, bars, festivals/events, etc. He's walked me back to my building and I walked myself inside.\r\n\r\nA month and a half in, we started to hang out at his apartment. Both after we went out and then as dates. We'd just watch movies, eat takeout, talk, etc.\r\n\r\nHe has a roommate: a friend from college. His roommate frequently hangs out with a friend who lives in their building and we typically try to schedule apartment dates then. There have been times when his roommate has come home early effectively cutting date night short.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\".

Two of them, Anna and Rachel, are struggling financially (Anna works as a waitress and Rachel can barely afford rent right now because her boyfriend just got laid off), so I reached out to them privately and said I would cover their hotel rooms for the two nights they'll be in town, the Friday night before the wedding and the night of the wedding. Rachel is bringing her boyfriend, so she'll be staying with him and Anna will be staying in a separate room. \r\n\r\nAnna apparently let it slip to the other girls that I was paying for their rooms, and now the other bridesmaids are really upset with me for not extending them the same offer. The rooms in the hotel where I'm getting married cost about $250 a night including taxes, and they say it's not fair that they have to pay $500 more than Anna and Rachel. But they make way more money than Anna and Rachel and can comfortably afford it. They're also in relationships/bringing dates, so I'd have  to pay for two separate rooms for them too, and that would cost me an extra $1,000 I wasn't planning on spending.

Two of them, Anna and Rachel, are struggling financially (Anna works as a waitress and Rachel can barely afford rent right now because her boyfriend just got laid off), so I reached out to them privately and said I would cover their hotel rooms for the two nights they'll be in town, the Friday night before the wedding and the night of the wedding. Rachel is bringing her boyfriend, so she'll be staying with him and Anna will be staying in a separate room. \r\n\r\nAnna apparently let it slip to the other girls that I was paying for their rooms, and now the other bridesmaids are really upset with me for not extending them the same offer. The rooms in the hotel where I'm getting married cost about $250 a night including taxes, and they say it's not fair that they have to pay $500 more than Anna and Rachel. But they make way more money than Anna and Rachel and can comfortably afford it. They're also in relationships/bringing dates, so I'd have  to pay for two separate rooms for them too, and that would cost me an extra $1,000 I wasn't planning on spending. I was just trying to do a nice thing, and now it's gotten out of hand. AITA?",

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting my 8 year old son keep his earring in? | So, I have shared custody of my son and he stays with his mom for a week and then he comes back to me for a week. I had him for three weeks in a row, because I was taking him on vacation, and then he just went to his moms for a week and returned to me today. To my surprise, he had an earring in. It was a diamond style earring in his right ear.\r\n\r\nHis mom didn\u2019t walk him up to the house or anything, she just sent him up to the house and drove off. I called her immediately and told her that I wasn\u2019t OK with it and that she should\u2019ve discussed it with me before doing it. She told me that it\u2019s the same thing as me taking him to get his haircut without her permission which I have done before. I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s the same thing because a haircut is a normal thing that a kid should get on a regular basis and an earring is not a normal thing for an eight-year-old boy to have and it\u2019s a change to the body. A haircut is not a change to the body.\r\n\r\nHim and his mom were telling me that he asked for it and that it was his idea, but I\u2019m not sure about that. He\u2019s never expressed any kind of interesting that before. I feel like she was the one pushing it.\r\n\r\nI told my son that he\u2019s not going to keep it in. I removed it immediately. I don\u2019t want him to go to school with it in. I told my son that it was wrong of his mom to do that without consulting me first. He seemed upset but not too terribly upset. I feel like he just didn\u2019t want to deal with his mom\u2018s reaction to it coming out since she paid to get it done. The idea of it just didn\u2019t sit well with me. He\u2019s just an 8 year old kid. When he\u2019s an adult, he can get whatever piercings he wants. Earrings for boys isn\u2019t even in the fashion right now, I don\u2019t think.

Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday.

Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\".

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

His voice cracked so much on the first \u201cCalifornia, here we come\u201d. I wanted to stop him from butchering the song because there will be a lot more screaming of that same line later in the song.

She said she heard the end of his horrible performance as well, but that gave me no right to criticize him, especially around so many people.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life.

In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends.

My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for threatening to leave my roommate if she doesn't close the curtains at night? | Long story short, I moved in with a friend of a friend a few months ago. We get along pretty well normally, but she has this awful habit of leaving the blinds and curtains wide open at all times. I don't care that much during the day, but at night it's incredibly unsettling. We live on the end of our apartment building with a bus stop right across the way. People can literally see directly into our unit from it or walking by. Like, they can watch our TV from the street. The sun is setting earlier and it's now dark when I come home from work, and every time I come back I have to pass the big window and see people outside looking in. We're both women and I've literally made eye contact with random men outside and it creeps me out. I've had to start walking through the living room in the dark (or with my phone as a flashlight) to close the blinds first because it's so unsettling. Yesterday I tripped while doing it and busted up my arm and wrist. This morning we had a huge fight about it and I told her to 100% stop opening the blinds at night or I was moving out. I close them every day but she opens them up again and says she forgets to close them before night. She has the smaller bedroom so pays less rent, and I know she can't really afford much else, but I can't keep doing this. It's just a month to month place so I told her to stop or I was going to put in 30 days. Today they were closed when I got home but she's still pissed.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously.

That week was around my friends bday celebration (her actual bday was the following week and she planned a bday trip with a group of friends)\r\nThe plan was to met at her house and then head to a local bar to meet a few other friends. I obviously was excited to tell my friends and was tired of lying about not drinking and didn\u2019t want people to assume my pregnancy and ask. I\u2019m not a good liar and was just honestly was ready for people to know. Before leaving the house we announced to the bday girl, her husband, a friend and their roommate. My friend did not seem happy for us but that\u2019s okay. I told my other close friend at the bar and did not say anything to the bday girl family members. The night was awkward to say the least and I was pretty hurt she was not excited for me. \r\nShe has ignored me for a while. I organized a dinner with close friends shortly after and she did not speak to me the whole time. I asked her to meet up to see what was going on. She said she was pissed I announced on her day and she was having a tough time and that was her time to vent and I stole the attention. \r\nI don\u2019t think I stole any attention. We low key told my BEST friends and their husbands. I did not steal attention away from her 31st bday at local dive bar. \r\n\r\nAm I an awful friend/person? My baby is now a few months old and our friendship has not recovered. Currently, not on speaking terms still.",

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for informing a good friend that a girl he's started dating completely ghosted me out of the blue? | So my good friend Johnathon recently started seeing a girl named Tiara. I was happy for him at first, but I realized I had gone on a few dates with Tiara 5-6 months prior.\r\n\r\nWe went on 3 dates that I honestly thought went well. She seemed interesting and fun. After the third date she didn't respond to a single text I sent her. No explanation, nothing. Like I get that 3 dates isn't much... But to go full ghost after a seemingly normal date without any follow-up made me pretty upset. I even tried to recall if I had said or done anything to maybe warrant this, and I couldn't think of anything that would prompt this. I moved on and basically forgot  about the whole situation. \r\n\r\nMy friend HATES ghosters with a passion. He thinks it's a terrible thing to do to someone and is probably one of the rudest things. \r\n\r\nWhen I found out it was the same girl, I told him like \"well maybe you'll have better luck than me, because she completely ghosted me after the 3rd date.\" He asked if he could see the last few texts we sent and it was pretty obvious that she was ghosting. \r\n\r\nHe spoke to her and said that he doesn't think they're compatible long term, etc. She kept prodding for an answer as to why and finally he told her that he really doesn't like ghosters and mentioned how he and I are friends. She didn't deny it - and basically said she was dating a few guys at the time and couldn't keep up with responding to all of them, and didn't really see me and her going past the 3rd date, so she decided to ignore me.\r\n\r\nSo... Lo and behold, Tiara texted me saying I was a piece of shit and that she really liked Johnathon. How I need to handle rejection better, etc etc. A few of my other friends are also saying that it was kind of a jerk move on my part. And that ghosting is no big deal.\r\n\r\nLook, I get that rejection happens and I'm not really that upset over it. But the way it went down just felt sour to me, and I wanted my friend to know the type of person she is.\r\n\r\nWas I being a salty asshole or was I justified with my warning?\"\"\"",

Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

We decided to drive separately as I had to help get things ready and she was going to meet me there when it started. The road leading to the building was a very busy two lane road where the speed limit was 40mph. To turn left into the parking lot other cars had to go around you.\r\n\r\nThis particular Friday night while cutting a ham I got a call from my wife saying \"I just got in a wreck outside, you have to hurry! It's bad! It's so bad!\" I immediately ran out of the building and saw the crunched Subaru she was driving and the Chevy Cruz that a business man was driving. The entire trunk of the outback was squished in half, the wheel wells were sticking out and neither back door could be open.

We decided to drive separately as I had to help get things ready and she was going to meet me there when it started.

To turn left into the parking lot other cars had to go around you.\r\n\r\nThis particular Friday night while cutting a ham I got a call from my wife saying \"I just got in a wreck outside, you have to hurry! It's bad! It's so bad!\" I immediately ran out of the building and saw the crunched Subaru she was driving and the Chevy Cruz that a business man was driving. The entire trunk of the outback was squished in half, the wheel wells were sticking out and neither back door could be open.

After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find.

I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic!

In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album.

She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE!

At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving.

So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"...

Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic!

He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue.

I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends.

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend.

After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her.

In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend.

When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE!

I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving.

Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for being annoyed that my housemate won't drop something I did? | This isn't even anywhere close to as dramatic as some of the posts here, but it's bugging me a lot and I want some outside perspective on it. \r\n\r\nSo I live with my childhood best friend, his fianc\u00e9e, and another housemate. The fianc\u00e9e is the one this situation concerns. She collects those  [Willow Tree figurines](https://www.willowtree.com) and I accidentally broke one whilst cleaning a few months back. I confessed to and apologised for it straight away, but she was super angry (justifiably so) because those things aren't exactly cheap and that one in particular had been a gift from her sister. I tried fixing it for her, but she complained it didn't look right, so I replaced it. I know it's not the same because it doesn't have the sentimental value of coming from her sister, and I definitely know that breaking it was my bad and I'm definitely the arseole there. \r\n\r\nHowever, it's been almost six months now and she won't let it go that I broke it. She makes \"jokes\" about it all the time, but they're those kind of jokes that you can just tell are thinly veiled jabs, and if we ever bicker or argue about something, she always and without fail throws it in my face. The latest incident was where she used and screwed up one of my watercolour palettes (we're both art students). I wasn't even pissed off because it wasn't like a super expensive palette and I was thinking of replacing it soon anyway but she made a point to go \"and you can't even be mad at me because *you've* broken my stuff.\" I got a little annoyed and told her to just fucking get over it already, and she got mad telling she she shouldn't *have to* get over it and she can be as mad as she wants. It kinda escalated into an argument, and now we're kind of a house divided. My friend is on her side, other roommate is on mine, and I'm wondering the opinion of total strangers to see if that can help us solve this omnishambles.\"\"\"",

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer.

For a while now, my animosity towards him has been growing because ever since he moved in he has done the following:\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-took random animal poop from my yard (that he assumed was my dog's even though it wasn't) and sent his daughter over to our yard to put it on our front porch\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-erected a fence that crossed our property line and when we told him he had to move it he laughed in our face\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-has guests coming in and out of his house day in and day out who drive over our grass with their cars and ruined it and when we tell them not to they tell us to fuck off.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-throws ragers almost every single saturday from 9am to 10pm and invites at least 100 people with music so loud it vibrates our house but I can't call the cops because technically low noise starts at 10.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-lets his rottweiler run leashless through our front yard and his kids run through our yard and trample our flowers despite us telling them not to\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n\\-called my daughter fat really loudly when she was in the back yard tanning then peeped over the fence and kept winking at her sarcastically and whistling\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe's done more stuff but you get the picture.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nSo this past Saturday, he threw another one of his ragers that vibrates my entire house. In his yard, he at least had 30 kids and 40 adults. I actually was really sick and wanted to sleep, but I could not because it was so loud. After 6 hours of trying to let it go like I usually do, I go outside and ask him to keep it down because I was sick and trying to sleep and he tells me \"its my yard I can do what I want\".\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nNow i'm furious. I go to my basement, pull out my surround sound subwoofers, plug it in outside, and blast the most annoying song I could possibly find. He comes over to the fence and asks me if i'm enjoying myself with the biggest smirk on his face. I tell him yeah.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nThen he turns off his music as his guests starts to leave and loudly says the party is over because I am a loser with no life. At this point i'm seeing red. I turn my music off  and basically: 1) question his manhood 2) called him an alcoholic (he is) 3) told him he ruined the entire neighborhood since moving in with all his parties and to go back to the sewer he came from 4) that all the neighbors hate him (they do) 5) start telling him off about all the stuff he has done I listed earlier 6) told him a normal human being would rent a venue for the number of guests and music he has in his yard 7) told him he looks like a toad (he does and he called my daughter fat so).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nHe looked shocked and all he said is \"how dare you use this language in front of my kids\" then I realize I just berated him in front of all these kids and all his guests. My wife thinks I am an asshole for telling him off like I did and wants me to apologize, but I really don't want to. Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for \"bullying\" my sister | \"Bullying\" because I didn't see it as bullying but apparently my sister and my mom did.\r\n\r\nFirst some important information:\r\nOur family has two cats which were both my sister's (15f) cats at first but because the other cat liked me more and follows me everywhere I go, my sister \"gave her to me\" as a birthday-gift like three years ago. So now one cat is mine and one is my sister's. \r\n\r\nSo, I (17f) came home from school and my cat, Lux, came to me and said \"hello I missed you\" in her own way (headbutting and purring and following me everywhere). When I lifted my cat up on my lap, my sister asked my cat \"Lux, are you excited about moving to some city* (my sister has send an application-letter to the school that she wants to go to, the school is in a city that is at least 300km away from our hometown where we are currently living in) with me when I'm accepted at the school?\" \r\nI got annoyed and said that Lux is mine and likes me more (which is true because my cat usually wants nothing to do with my sister but still my cat loves me and even sleeps next to me when I'm sleeping) and also that Lux wouldn't want to live with my sister because Lux wouldn't be able to go outside there and now here she gets to go outside every time she wants to because we have a big yard and my sister would only have an apartment if she moves. Lux spends usually a couple of hours a day outside. \r\nWhile I was saying all this, I heard my sister whisper to my mom \"no Lux is not her cat\". Then my sister began to say that \"Yes she's moving with me, yes she is, she will move anywhere where I move\". \r\nAt this point I got very angry and said almist crying that \"I need Lux, she IS my cat and I want her to live with me\". Then my mom stopped me by shouting \"YOU HAVE TO STOP BULLYING YOUR SISTER! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS BULLYING HER? I DOM'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU ANYMORE! GO TO YOUR ROOM AND BE QUIET! \r\n\r\nSo now I'm in my room crying, Lux heard me cry and came here too and she is purring next to me. \r\nI feel like my sister was bullying me more than I was bullying her so I wanted to hear if I'm really the AH and just not seeing things clearly. That's why I'm here asking AITA? \r\n\r\nAlso I feel like my cat is the most important person (yes, I consider cats as persons :D) in my life and I don't know what I would do without her. She is my best friend and is with me all the time and also I want her to be happy and to be able to go outside if she wants to.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting a bit bigger of an engagement ring? | My boyfriend proposed this morning and I was ecstatic! We\u2019ve been together for 4 years and it was totally unexpected since I really thought it might happen in the summer.\r\nWe did go ring shopping together, and he knew what I liked as well as diamond sizes.\r\n\r\nI feel terrible saying this but I really don\u2019t like the size of the stone. It\u2019s a solitaire so there\u2019s no side stones at all. It\u2019s .39 carats. One of my friends said it looks like a promise ring which really kinda stung.\r\nI don\u2019t think she meant to hurt my feelings but I felt like she was judging me and him and our finances.\r\nAnother friend along with her was scruntching her eyes pretending she couldn\u2019t see it.\r\nBesides them being just shallow they said such a small ring isn\u2019t going to last a lifetime and will have to be replaced if it\u2019s worn daily.\r\n\r\nOur financial situation is good, really good. He could have afforded a larger stone so this isn\u2019t the issue. He also knew the ones I showed him were a bit larger.\r\nI feel like maybe he went on the cheaper side just to be frugal which I normally understand but I\u2019m going to be wearing this for the rest of my life. I really don\u2019t want to upgrade because it\u2019s not as special as an original.\r\nHe left all the paperwork in the box and he spent $2900. I feel for this once in a lifetime purchase it\u2019s not too much to ask for something in the 5k range and .80-1 carat. \r\n\r\nAll of my friends and even family have at least 1 carat rings if not bigger. In our area it\u2019s not uncommon to see large diamonds up to 2.5 carats. \r\nI know it\u2019s snobby and I wouldn\u2019t expect something that big, but I felt 1 carat is a good middle ground. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to mention this and what to even do. I feel like I\u2019m screwed either secretly hating it or him getting disappointed.\r\n\r\nEdit- I do not dislike the ring because of my friends. I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting.

I was unhappy with the size before anyone even saw it.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not hanging out with or giving rides to my boyfriends family because they do drugs and are dirty. | My boyfriends family (his mom, sister and brothers) smoke marijuana and do other drugs in the regular. \r\n\r\nI have a 7 year old from a previous marriage and I take parenting seriously. My son has asthma and epilepsy so environments are a huge deal for us. \r\n\r\nI also like clean places that smell clean. His family is not into clean places as much. I refuse to take my son over there because I have been in that house. It is dirty. There are drugs there. It isn\u2019t a place for children. \r\n\r\nMy boyfriend isn\u2019t like them. He doesn\u2019t do drugs. He doesn\u2019t even drink but he loves spending time with his family who often do those things in his presence. He invites me but I just can\u2019t go. We went one time and all the adults were drunk/high and no one was watching the kids. I made him take us home after 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nHis mother and brother often ask me for rides but they have been arrested with drugs on her before. She once left some marijuana in my boyfriends car. Like she dropped it and didn\u2019t notice. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t want them around my son. I don\u2019t want to hang out with them. I don\u2019t want to be around them. \r\n\r\nI am prepared for that to be a dealbreaker to my boyfriend who seems understanding but hurt by it. \r\n\r\nHis family says I am a \u201ccold stuck up bitch\u201d. Maybe I am but I don\u2019t want to get in trouble for their lifestyle. Am I really an asshole? \r\nHe says you just have to love them for who they are.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than 30 minutes late? | My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and we were going to meet there.\r\n\r\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33 I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough since I had no clue whether she would even come.\r\n\r\nShe responds at 7:38 saying \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the subway, along with some missed calls from her.\r\n\r\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\r\n\r\nShe went to her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \r\n\r\nAITA?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.\r\n\r\nI am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?\r\n\r\nIve been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.\r\n\r\nI organized all of these pictures into three \"Chapters\" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.\r\n\r\nPast is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.\r\n\r\nPresent is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.\r\n\r\nFuture is filled with her and myself together.\r\n\r\nI thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.\r\n\r\nThis project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to participate in our for-profit, limited liability company's fundraising events with my own money? | \"George, I have noticed you hadn't bought a single raffle ticket yet. Go on, they're only a pound, for a chance to win 50!\", my manager asked me today.\r\n\r\n\"Oh. It's because I don't approve of gambling, Sarah\", I responded, as it was the first excuse that popped into my mind. I thought it would be enough for her not to push the subject any further. I was wrong.\r\n\r\n\"It's not gambling! It's a raffle! The remainder of the money raised goes into the Resident Support Fund. It directly benefits our home's Residents\", the manager replied.\r\n\r\nLet's pause for a bit. Our company owns about 40 nursing homes across England. It's an LTD, so the financial statements are not a secret. Last year, they reported a profit of over \u00a32.5M. Yet about 80% of our staff, especially the carers, are making just a fraction above national minimum wage. If you're not a manager on a contract, there's no bonuses. The staff are charged for everything - from uniforms to lunches.\r\n\r\nBeing a resident of a nursing home isn't cheap either. It costs more per week than I make in a month.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the Resident Support Fund? Sometimes we throw parties, sometimes we get a new telly for the lounge, sometimes we do some re-furbishing. Pretty much standard business costs in the care industry that should be covered with our Clients' hard-earned money. Yet apparently they aren't - and we need to supplement it. But she must've known all that. So instead of trying the reasonable approach, this is what came out of my mouth:\r\n\r\n\"That's nice. I wish Sainsbury's employees had a Shopper Support Fund. Why don't they all chip in? Don't they realise it would directly benefit us, the paying customers?\" - I realised how passive-aggressive and stand-offish it sounded the second I responded. Sarcasm is the default dialogue option for a Brit. Its how communicate, but I fully own the fact that it could've been perceived as uncalled for.\r\n\r\nSuffice to say, Sarah wasn't pleased. Other people overheard my apparent insubordination. Monday week, I have a meeting with her, the deputy and the HR lady. I highly doubt the meeting is going to be about the ethical quandaries of pressuring low-paid staff into giving back the money to their employer. I have a feeling it's going to be about \"teamwork\", \"going the extra mile\", \"charity\", \"work spirit\" and \"we're all in this together\".\r\n\r\nObviously, that's just my point of view. I haven't got the faintest clue how it looked from the manager's perspective. She's the one that has to answer to the Regional Manager and the CEO, after all.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask anything. Don't know if it matters, but I'm 30, male, and I'm the Social Activities Conductor. Arts n Crafts, Bingo, quizzes, outings, booking entertainers, throwing b-day parties, doing the newsletter, that sort of thing (I have a separate budget for all that). It's not about the money. It's a matter of principle.\r\n\r\nSo. Is George the arsehole in this situation?\"\"\"",
