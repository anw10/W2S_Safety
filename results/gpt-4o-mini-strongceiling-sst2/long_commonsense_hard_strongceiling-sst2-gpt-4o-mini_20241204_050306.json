I was really into her and we had a pretty good relationship. However, as I found out soon after we started dating, she\u2019s very, very anti-war. Like, hippie pacifist flower anti-war, almost. Before I knew this, I hadn\u2019t talked to her about my service in the Marines, and I definitely wasn\u2019t looking forward to discussing it. \n\nI deployed to Iraq with 3rd Marines in 2004 and fought in Fallujah.

She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal.

It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions.

He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning.

Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal.

It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions.

He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft.

She even told me about all her ex boyfriend's fetishes (like being into feet and other dudes etc) and that he was jealous that the two of us were hanging out. This worried me, and I told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with her airing out my dirty laundry under any circumstance, and specifically asked her to never do that. She obliged, but I still wasn't sure if I could trust her. So I made up a social test.\n\nI lied and told her I was into furries  (I'm not, though there's nothing wrong with people that are you do you) and I asked a friend of her's if she could help me test her by asking what my fetish is. She agreed, then went on to ask her when I wasn't around. I got a call back from her saying that the girl that I was seeing said I might be into furry creatures and stuff, and that she basically told her right away. So she failed. \n\nI did end up telling her that it was a test, but then she got furious with me. She thought it was unbelievable that I could betray her trust like that.

My boyfriend saw it as well and wanted to go find a employe to report it, but I didn't wanna get involved and I also felt kinda sorry for the girl because she was shoplifting food and deodorant so I pressured him to drop it.  He argued but I insisted that we let it go, which he eventually agreed to, but later called me an asshole when we saw the girl walk out with her bagpack.

I was really into her and we had a pretty good relationship. However, as I found out soon after we started dating, she\u2019s very, very anti-war. Like, hippie pacifist flower anti-war, almost. Before I knew this, I hadn\u2019t talked to her about my service in the Marines, and I definitely wasn\u2019t looking forward to discussing it. \n\nI deployed to Iraq with 3rd Marines in 2004 and fought in Fallujah. Eventually, a month or two ago, we got to talking about what I was doing at that point in my life, and not wanting to cause conflict but also wanting to be truthful, I told her that I served in the Marines but never deployed. She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal. Apparently her sister told her that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with a liar\u201d so she broke up with me. \n\nAITA for not telling her the truth?\n\nEDIT: thanks for the input everybody. It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft.

If he gets fired because of me, He could land me in trouble.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting to give my maid the 7Eleven stamps I collected? | 7Eleven in Bangkok give out 1 \"Doraemon\" stamp for every 50 baht purchased and there is a sheet on which we can stick all the collected stamps. Each stamp has different monetary value (1 or 3 baht), and depending on how many stamps are collected, different products can be redeemed such as Doraemon lunchboxes or jugs or plushies.\n\nThis morning, my maid asked my mom if she had any stamps to give but I was asleep at that time. When I woke up, my parents have been asking me to give all my collected stamps (around 100 of them) to my maid. I refused because I put in the effort to collect those stamps. My parents told me I was being selfish because I didn't need the stamps anyways and the products that could be redeemed weren't useful to me either. They told me I should give my stamps to my maid, who would certainly benefit from them and make better use of.\n\nThe only reasons I collect the stamps are:\n\n* It gives me a feeling of satisfaction when I stick stamps on the collection sheet.\n* The products that could be redeemed are not useful to me, and if I do ever redeem anything - it would feel like something I \"earned\" rather than buying it.\n\nAITA for not wanting to give my maid the 7Eleven stamps I collected?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA when someone interrupts me when I am speaking, I continue to speak, over their words and louder |  \n\nAITA When I am out to dinner at a restaurant with my wife, daughter and son in law, my wife and SIL will routinely interrupt me when I am speaking. When my SIL does this, I continue speaking and SIL and I both continue speaking at the same time, and I raise my voice louder than SIL. Everyone ignores what I am saying and focuses on the person who interrupted me and thinks I am rude for shutting my mouth anytime anyone interrupts me.\n\nAm I the only person that thinks it's rude and disrespectful to interrupts someone who is speaking? Am I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA For serectly testing a girl that i was seeing. | I was seeing this girl that had a history of running her mouth. She even told me about all her ex boyfriend's fetishes (like being into feet and other dudes etc) and that he was jealous that the two of us were hanging out. This worried me, and I told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with her airing out my dirty laundry under any circumstance, and specifically asked her to never do that. She obliged, but I still wasn't sure if I could trust her. So I made up a social test.\n\nI lied and told her I was into furries  (I'm not, though there's nothing wrong with people that are you do you) and I asked a friend of her's if she could help me test her by asking what my fetish is. She agreed, then went on to ask her when I wasn't around. I got a call back from her saying that the girl that I was seeing said I might be into furry creatures and stuff, and that she basically told her right away. So she failed. \n\nI did end up telling her that it was a test, but then she got furious with me. She thought it was unbelievable that I could betray her trust like that. She still wanted to see me but I needed a break. AITA?\n\nEdit: Spelling and I also should add that she wasn't my girlfriend. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not reporting a girl that was shoplifting? | Basically the title. My boyfriend and I were grocery shopping at a big supermarket. When we were standing in the cosmetics aisle I saw a 12-13 year old girl put deodorant in her backpack. I could also see that she had other stuff in there, cereal and and grapes. She wasn't very inconspicuous but it's a huge supermarket so I guess nobody noticed. My boyfriend saw it as well and wanted to go find a employe to report it, but I didn't wanna get involved and I also felt kinda sorry for the girl because she was shoplifting food and deodorant so I pressured him to drop it.  He argued but I insisted that we let it go, which he eventually agreed to, but later called me an asshole when we saw the girl walk out with her bagpack. He was mad about it saying that the employees will get in trouble for the missing stuff. Was I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not being honest with my (now ex) girlfriend about my military service? | Throwaway because she uses reddit. \n\n\nI recently broke up with a girl who I had been dating for a couple months. I was really into her and we had a pretty good relationship. However, as I found out soon after we started dating, she\u2019s very, very anti-war. Like, hippie pacifist flower anti-war, almost. Before I knew this, I hadn\u2019t talked to her about my service in the Marines, and I definitely wasn\u2019t looking forward to discussing it. \n\nI deployed to Iraq with 3rd Marines in 2004 and fought in Fallujah. Eventually, a month or two ago, we got to talking about what I was doing at that point in my life, and not wanting to cause conflict but also wanting to be truthful, I told her that I served in the Marines but never deployed. She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal. Apparently her sister told her that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with a liar\u201d so she broke up with me. \n\nAITA for not telling her the truth?\n\nEDIT: thanks for the input everybody. It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate.

I was really into her and we had a pretty good relationship. However, as I found out soon after we started dating, she\u2019s very, very anti-war. Like, hippie pacifist flower anti-war, almost.

She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers.

I spiraled into a deep depression without my best friend and am still working on myself to this day but his family dealt with it much worse eventually splitting up all together. Skip ahead 2 weeks to the day of Alex\u2019s funeral.\u00a0 His family said their piece and invited me and my mother to the podium to speak about Alex. I gave a 5 minute speech about everything we went through as best friends and how appreciative of the time I got with him I was. After I spoke they let anyone come up and say their piece as well so our coach spoke, some of our teammates spoke, and then I see a girl I knew from school but wasn\u2019t very fond of come up and speak, enter April.\u00a0\r\nApril approaches the podium bawling her eyes out and then goes on to say they were in love and they were so close and how she\u2019ll never get over this and even told fake stories of their intimacy and \u201ccrazy adventures\u201d they had together. Knowing Alex spoke to her once over DM and on occasion in passing at school, I became enraged. Alex was my best friend we talked about everything I knew every girl he was intimate with and every little detail of his love life as he knew mine. Alex never liked her and even made a comment to me once about how fake she is for Instagram and how she over exaggerates everything for attention ( she would make videos of her crying anytime a tragedy would occur on the news and say she just wanted to die because the world was too tough). Anyway, after the ceremony she approached me and told me we all love him dearly and \u201cI\u2019ll miss him as much as you do... IF NOT MORE\u201d. This sent me over the deep end and I went off on her in the parking lot saying she was despicable for trying to garner attention off of my best friends tragic death and we used to laugh at how pathetic she was. She began crying and someone got in my face for harassing her and it spilled onto social media.\u00a0 It was their that I post a half hour story explaining what she was doing and even showing my best friends dm he screenshot and sent to me to laugh about her awkward messaging. People were all over the place about it and she ended up getting it pretty bad after this and had to move schools and delete her social media\u2019s. AITA for what I did?",

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

My daughter is with her mom most of the time, so I like her time with me to be special. Her visit this time coincided with my step daughters birthday, so she was going to be there for the party. \n\nMy wife told my daughter she could invite one friend to the party so she had someone to hang out with. However, like most 12 year olds, my daughter struggled to choose which friend to invite. She told me that she was worried that some friends would get angry if they weren\u2019t invited. I told her just to invite her whole friend group to make it easier.\n\nI thought the older kids would do their own thing at the party, but they wanted to participate. There were more younger kids, but the older kids were definitely more talkative and just did more. After the party, my wife raged at me for inviting more 12 year olds without consulting her and for \u201cletting my daughter take over her daughters party.\u201d I pointed out that I want my daughter to feel welcome and happy when visiting and I never want her to have social struggles because of anything going on. I also planned the party with my wife so I don\u2019t think I should have to consult her about some changes. She accused me of favoritism but I feel like she\u2019s playing favorites.

Each stamp has different monetary value (1 or 3 baht), and depending on how many stamps are collected, different products can be redeemed such as Doraemon lunchboxes or jugs or plushies.\n\nThis morning, my maid asked my mom if she had any stamps to give but I was asleep at that time. When I woke up, my parents have been asking me to give all my collected stamps (around 100 of them) to my maid. I refused because I put in the effort to collect those stamps.

This worried me, and I told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with her airing out my dirty laundry under any circumstance, and specifically asked her to never do that. She obliged, but I still wasn't sure if I could trust her. So I made up a social test.\n\nI lied and told her I was into furries  (I'm not, though there's nothing wrong with people that are you do you) and I asked a friend of her's if she could help me test her by asking what my fetish is. She agreed, then went on to ask her when I wasn't around. I got a call back from her saying that the girl that I was seeing said I might be into furry creatures and stuff, and that she basically told her right away.

My boyfriend saw it as well and wanted to go find a employe to report it, but I didn't wanna get involved and I also felt kinda sorry for the girl because she was shoplifting food and deodorant so I pressured him to drop it.  He argued but I insisted that we let it go, which he eventually agreed to, but later called me an asshole when we saw the girl walk out with her bagpack.

I was really into her and we had a pretty good relationship. However, as I found out soon after we started dating, she\u2019s very, very anti-war. Like, hippie pacifist flower anti-war, almost. Before I knew this, I hadn\u2019t talked to her about my service in the Marines, and I definitely wasn\u2019t looking forward to discussing it. \n\nI deployed to Iraq with 3rd Marines in 2004 and fought in Fallujah.

She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal. Apparently her sister told her that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with a liar\u201d so she broke up with me. \n\nAITA for not telling her the truth?\n\nEDIT: thanks for the input everybody. It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate.

Then she says that she doesn't know if it would have gotten to her place in time. I say of course It will!

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate.

She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil.

Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things.

My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me.

As soon as we could, we messaged explaining and gave the new address, thinking he could decide to cancel if it was too far to drive.

We saw his car coming and assumed he was delivering to my house with no issue.\n\nHe comes to the door and I greet/thank him, then he says how the address was different so I tried to apologise and explain but I never got to. He interrupted and said he only did the delivery out of the kindness of his soul and usually after 7 minutes with no collection would trash the food and move on. He said that Uber doesn\u2019t pay him the extra fuel for driving to my house instead of my GF\u2019s. He paid it out of his own pocket and kept saying how he didn\u2019t have to. I got no words in as he was giving me this long lecture about the order.

I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate.

She ended up getting pregnant and then moving to a different state. That didn\u2019t work out, so they moved back here. I was still there for here, and was still her best friend through all of this. One day, we were hanging out, having a good time. We went to the mall, I bought us BOTH some lunch, and then we went back home. I told her I would be right back as I needed to use the bathroom. While I was in the bathroom, she stole my card out of my purse without me knowing. I came back, and she said she had to go. So I have her a hug, we said I love you, and she left. Later that night, I went to the store to buy some groceries. I went to pay, and my card was no where to be found. I thought I must have left it at home. I checked my account as soon as I got home and $300 was missing. There were charges from Victoria secret, target, and some other places I can\u2019t remember. I was in shock, and so upset.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things.

In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me.

Our mom died when I was young, our dad left, and we were raised by our grandmother. A year ago, she was diagnosed with cancer and Mary moved back in to care for her. \n\nTwo weeks ago, she passed away.

When she died, I agreed to stay in the country to help plan the funeral and handle legalities with her estate.\n\nIn our grandma's will, her inheritance was divided very evenly. She had left the house to Mary, which we all agreed was more than fair. Although the house was Mary's, she left the divvying up of the furniture to my sisters and I. We agreed to go through the house and put post-it's with our name on it on the furniture we wanted. More than one post-it, we would duke it out amongst the two who wanted it. No post-its, it'd be sold at an estate sale. \n\nI live a fairly nomadic life, so I didn't want much. Since my sisters were claiming pretty much everything else, I decided the two things I wanted was a brooch and a small lamp. The lamp was first in my grandma's nursery, then my mom's, then Kylie and Nora's. \n\nBy the time we had finished stickying everything we wanted, we realized that all 8 of us had claimed the lamp. I told my sisters that it was only fair that I take it, since I only wanted the two things, while the rest of them had essentially taken the whole house. Kylie felt that since it had been \"hers\" most recently, it should be hers, but Nora felt she had a similar claim. Jane didn't \"want much\" so she felt deserving of the lamp. Elle wanted it in lieu of a wedding gift from our grandma (who was too poor to buy her one), and Ruth wanted it as furnishing for her new place. Mary thought she deserved it for taking care of gran, and Jill felt it was fair that it go in \\*her\\* daughter's room. \n\nI told Kylie, who also wanted the brooch, that she could have it if I got the lamp.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers.

It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate.

This worried me, and I told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with her airing out my dirty laundry under any circumstance, and specifically asked her to never do that. She obliged, but I still wasn't sure if I could trust her.

I was really into her and we had a pretty good relationship. However, as I found out soon after we started dating, she\u2019s very, very anti-war. Like, hippie pacifist flower anti-war, almost. Before I knew this, I hadn\u2019t talked to her about my service in the Marines, and I definitely wasn\u2019t looking forward to discussing it. \n\nI deployed to Iraq with 3rd Marines in 2004 and fought in Fallujah.

She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal.

It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning.

He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

Would I be the asshole for quitting over this? \n\nI am a front desk clerk at a hotel. I\u2019ve only just started working here, but it\u2019s honestly been pretty shitty and I\u2019ve been considering quitting. This particular thing might be the last straw though.\n\nSome background: a week ago we found a bed bug infestation in three of the rooms. On Friday I went into work and those rooms had been sprayed and treated a few hours prior. They had completely taken apart all of the furniture to spray everything, and so we wouldn\u2019t be able to rent those rooms for the night. \n\nWe are the closest hotel to a college campus with a popular football team, so we are always at full capacity on game weekends, which this was. I quickly realized that we had reservations for every room, but those three rooms were un-rentable because they had been sprayed for bed bugs, meaning we wouldn\u2019t have enough rooms for everyone that was going to check in that day. I went to work at 5 pm and somehow no one else had realized this all day, so I was the only one that knew there was a problem. Me and the maintenance guy were the only people there. I quickly called my manager and explained the situation to him, and he insisted that we put all of the furniture together again and rent those rooms that had JUST been treated for bed bugs because we had no other choice. So the maintenance guy put the furniture in those rooms back together while I worked front desk, and we were luckily able to get them put together again before all of the guest arrived and they had to be rented. It was a big fiasco and hugely stressful, but we figured it out.\n\nI had only been in those rooms that had bed bugs in them for a few minutes, but tonight I was hanging out with my bf and he found a bed bug crawling on him. Now I\u2019m seriously stressed about an infestation because I know they can be hard to get rid of.\n\nThere are a few things about this job that have also made me want to quit that I won\u2019t get into here because it would take too long, but now I\u2019ve taken bed bugs to my own home from my WORKPLACE. My boyfriend insist that I quit. My boyfriend says it\u2019s unacceptable, and this on top of the other things are not typical of retail. He\u2019s worked retail before too, and he says that none of this is okay and I\u2019m completely justified in quitting on the spot. I told my mom all of this however, and she keeps telling me that this is all normal and even told me that bed bugs aren\u2019t that bad. I just can\u2019t tell what\u2019s acceptable and what isn\u2019t. Would I be the asshole for quitting without a two weeks notice and just not going back?\"\"\"",

Would I be the asshole for quitting over this? \n\nI am a front desk clerk at a hotel. I\u2019ve only just started working here, but it\u2019s honestly been pretty shitty and I\u2019ve been considering quitting. This particular thing might be the last straw though.\n\nSome background: a week ago we found a bed bug infestation in three of the rooms. On Friday I went into work and those rooms had been sprayed and treated a few hours prior. They had completely taken apart all of the furniture to spray everything, and so we wouldn\u2019t be able to rent those rooms for the night. \n\nWe are the closest hotel to a college campus with a popular football team, so we are always at full capacity on game weekends, which this was. I quickly realized that we had reservations for every room, but those three rooms were un-rentable because they had been sprayed for bed bugs, meaning we wouldn\u2019t have enough rooms for everyone that was going to check in that day. I went to work at 5 pm and somehow no one else had realized this all day, so I was the only one that knew there was a problem. Me and the maintenance guy were the only people there. I quickly called my manager and explained the situation to him, and he insisted that we put all of the furniture together again and rent those rooms that had JUST been treated for bed bugs because we had no other choice. So the maintenance guy put the furniture in those rooms back together while I worked front desk, and we were luckily able to get them put together again before all of the guest arrived and they had to be rented. It was a big fiasco and hugely stressful, but we figured it out.\n\nI had only been in those rooms that had bed bugs in them for a few minutes, but tonight I was hanging out with my bf and he found a bed bug crawling on him. Now I\u2019m seriously stressed about an infestation because I know they can be hard to get rid of.\n\nThere are a few things about this job that have also made me want to quit that I won\u2019t get into here because it would take too long, but now I\u2019ve taken bed bugs to my own home from my WORKPLACE. My boyfriend insist that I quit. My boyfriend says it\u2019s unacceptable, and this on top of the other things are not typical of retail. He\u2019s worked retail before too, and he says that none of this is okay and I\u2019m completely justified in quitting on the spot. I told my mom all of this however, and she keeps telling me that this is all normal and even told me that bed bugs aren\u2019t that bad. I just can\u2019t tell what\u2019s acceptable and what isn\u2019t. Would I be the asshole for quitting without a two weeks notice and just not going back?",

Each stamp has different monetary value (1 or 3 baht), and depending on how many stamps are collected, different products can be redeemed such as Doraemon lunchboxes or jugs or plushies.\n\nThis morning, my maid asked my mom if she had any stamps to give but I was asleep at that time. When I woke up, my parents have been asking me to give all my collected stamps (around 100 of them) to my maid. I refused because I put in the effort to collect those stamps. My parents told me I was being selfish because I didn't need the stamps anyways and the products that could be redeemed weren't useful to me either. They told me I should give my stamps to my maid, who would certainly benefit from them and make better use of.\n\nThe only reasons I collect the stamps are:\n\n* It gives me a feeling of satisfaction when I stick stamps on the collection sheet.\n* The products that could be redeemed are not useful to me, and if I do ever redeem anything - it would feel like something I \"earned\" rather than buying it.\n\nAITA for not wanting to give my maid the 7Eleven stamps I collected?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA when someone interrupts me when I am speaking, I continue to speak, over their words and louder |  \n\nAITA When I am out to dinner at a restaurant with my wife, daughter and son in law, my wife and SIL will routinely interrupt me when I am speaking. When my SIL does this, I continue speaking and SIL and I both continue speaking at the same time, and I raise my voice louder than SIL.

She even told me about all her ex boyfriend's fetishes (like being into feet and other dudes etc) and that he was jealous that the two of us were hanging out. This worried me, and I told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with her airing out my dirty laundry under any circumstance, and specifically asked her to never do that. She obliged, but I still wasn't sure if I could trust her. So I made up a social test.\n\nI lied and told her I was into furries  (I'm not, though there's nothing wrong with people that are you do you) and I asked a friend of her's if she could help me test her by asking what my fetish is. She agreed, then went on to ask her when I wasn't around. I got a call back from her saying that the girl that I was seeing said I might be into furry creatures and stuff, and that she basically told her right away. So she failed. \n\nI did end up telling her that it was a test, but then she got furious with me. She thought it was unbelievable that I could betray her trust like that. She still wanted to see me but I needed a break.

My boyfriend and I were grocery shopping at a big supermarket. When we were standing in the cosmetics aisle I saw a 12-13 year old girl put deodorant in her backpack. I could also see that she had other stuff in there, cereal and and grapes. She wasn't very inconspicuous but it's a huge supermarket so I guess nobody noticed. My boyfriend saw it as well and wanted to go find a employe to report it, but I didn't wanna get involved and I also felt kinda sorry for the girl because she was shoplifting food and deodorant so I pressured him to drop it.  He argued but I insisted that we let it go, which he eventually agreed to, but later called me an asshole when we saw the girl walk out with her bagpack. He was mad about it saying that the employees will get in trouble for the missing stuff. Was I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not being honest with my (now ex) girlfriend about my military service? | Throwaway because she uses reddit. \n\n\nI recently broke up with a girl who I had been dating for a couple months. I was really into her and we had a pretty good relationship. However, as I found out soon after we started dating, she\u2019s very, very anti-war. Like, hippie pacifist flower anti-war, almost. Before I knew this, I hadn\u2019t talked to her about my service in the Marines, and I definitely wasn\u2019t looking forward to discussing it. \n\nI deployed to Iraq with 3rd Marines in 2004 and fought in Fallujah. Eventually, a month or two ago, we got to talking about what I was doing at that point in my life, and not wanting to cause conflict but also wanting to be truthful, I told her that I served in the Marines but never deployed. She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal. Apparently her sister told her that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with a liar\u201d so she broke up with me. \n\nAITA for not telling her the truth?\n\nEDIT: thanks for the input everybody. It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate. I have already spent near 2K on him in the last few months - digging through the little I have saved since I started working part time at age 14. \n\n\nAITA?

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby.

Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil.

Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What the fuck?\n\nSo I brought all my food back into my room, except for a few \"looks good, decoys(bullshit I don't eat) I left in the fridge\" so I figure, hey, I have a bag of chips or whatever, I'm not going to walk outside and eat than go back in after I'm done when I have it right here? I make no mess and anything I do is cleaned beyond recognition. \n\nWhat gets me busted is the carrying of dishes and cups back and forth to my room. What's fucking crazy is that the homeowner complained about another roommate making noise cooking food in the kitchen at 2am which apperantly woke her up??\n\nAm I the asshole?",

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers.

I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate.

The owner was a nurse and came back home late at night after we had settled in. My dog is skittish and she barked at the owner, who must have seemed like an intruder in her new home. Thankfully the owner seemed very understanding.\n\nThe next day we met the owner\u2019s own dog. It was a small Dachshund and it barked a lot at my dog. The owner said sorry for the barking and from then on put him in her room whenever we came out.\n\nThe third day, I was eating dinner with my dog in the dining room, which shared a glass wall with the sunroom where the owner's cats stayed. My dog hates cats and started growling at them when she saw them through the glass, just as the owner walked out of her room. The owner let out a big sigh and angrily said \"Can I give you some advice? I've had dogs all my life and it's not cool for your dog to growl at me. You gotta be firm with them and nip that in the bud or they'll walk all over you.\"\n\nI was flabbergasted and just replied \u201cOK,\u201d but I got more mad as I thought about it afterwards.\n\nFirst of all she wasn't even growling at the owner, she was growling at her cats. Second, I didn't appreciate that she implied that I was not a good owner and was being walked over. Every single time she barked or growled I was doing my best to stop her and make her feel safe, even if it might not have seemed as firm or effective as the owner thought. Third, her own dog barked like crazy and she had even less control of him. I felt betrayed by a fellow reactive dog owner who I thought was understanding.\n\nIt was only after I ended my stay that I made my frustrations known. I didn't give her a bad review but left a rather rude message:\n\nThank you for hosting me. I wish I could say I had a great stay, but to be honest with you now, it was ruined when you angrily (and hypocritically) gave me unsolicited advice on training my dog. Also, your many comments demonizing her and making a big fuss every time we stepped outside made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome in your home. I'm glad you changed your listing to no pets because you're obviously not very good with them. I suggest you take your own advice in controlling your dog's incessant barking; maybe read up on that \"Dachshunds for Dummies.\"\n\nI later received a message from Airbnb telling me that my account received a warning and to make sure my pet does not present a risk. Furious, I called Airbnb support and filed a similar complaint about the owner's dog.\n\nNow months after the fact, I somewhat regret my pettiness. My dog's reactivity has gotten worse since then and sometimes I feel maybe the owner was right in some ways and I also could have been more upfront. We understand her reactivity more now (shoutout to r/reactivedogs) and have been working hard to train her, more methodically than we had been at the time of the incident.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate. I have already spent near 2K on him in the last few months - digging through the little I have saved since I started working part time at age 14. \n\n\nAITA?

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things.

It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate. I have already spent near 2K on him in the last few months - digging through the little I have saved since I started working part time at age 14. \n\n\nAITA?

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate. I have already spent near 2K on him in the last few months - digging through the little I have saved since I started working part time at age 14. \n\n\nAITA?

My sperm bank provides a lot of information about the donor. A physical description, medical history, professional background, a list of hobbies/interests, a childhood picture of the donor etc. \n\nSome donors are open to being contacted when the child is an adult. I wanted to find a donor open to this but I was not able to. I chose my donor because he matched all of the other requirements relating to health and was from the same ethnic background as me. That sounds bad, but I feel a strong connection to my home country even though I no longer live there, and it was important to me that my child be the same ethnicity. No other donors matched ethnic background AND my other requirements. Men of my ethnicity don't commonly donate. This wasn't a decision I took lightly. I considered many profiles. I spent weeks deciding. None of the open donors felt right. I don't feel positive about the closed donation. I'd feel unsatisfied never knowing or being able to have a conversation with a biological half of me but I've talked it through with a therapist and come to accept that my family can be enough for my child. \n\nI'm taking steps to give my child an idea of the biological half they are missing by making an identity box. I included all of the information I have on the donor in the box and my child will grow up understanding their background and the reasons they don't have a father. \n\nOne of the reasons I made my peace with the closed donation is that the bank promised a letter from the donor to the child. I thought at least a letter could give an older child or teenager some closure if they were curious about their biological Father. I received the letter last week. It really isn't a letter. It's clear that the donor was asked to write something while in the office for medicals or something and wrote on a scrap of paper in a hurry. It's a photocopy of the paper and the note is three lines in total. Without quoting verbatim it says:\n\n\"This is the strangest thing I've done but it's cool I get to help someone have kids! Good luck in life. I hope it works out for you.\" \n\nIt feels anti-climatic to me so I can only imagine how it will feel to my child. I was talking to a friend about it this weekend and I mentioned that I was thinking of typing up something 'from' the donor that was a little more encouraging or at least a little longer. I wouldn't change the essence of the note but I would expand on it so it didn't feel so half-assed. I feel terrible for my child. I know I'll provide all the love and stability in the world but there will come a time when they will wonder.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil.

She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers.

The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate. I have already spent near 2K on him in the last few months - digging through the little I have saved since I started working part time at age 14. \n\n\nAITA?

This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby.

Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

I laughed about it and said \u2018ey lad you\u2019ve grown a pair haven\u2019t you?\u2019 \n\nThat set him off and the screaming really began, constant tirade of calling me a fat bastard, etc. I lifted my phone up which was in my hand and told him I\u2019d send this to his mum as she\u2019d be absolutely mortified if she knew what he was doing. \n\nSure enough he carried on so I sent her the vid over WhatsApp. I carried on with my day and I get a call from her later saying she\u2019s grounded him and he\u2019s no longer allowed out apart from school. \n\nBecause I live in a fairly small town somehow the video got onto Facebook and lots and lots of people are commenting and weighing in. Since everyone knows it\u2019s me, people are tagging me left right and centre saying I was out of order and I\u2019m a shitestirrer. In my opinion I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, he was screaming in a public place and I deserved to have proof of his behaviour",

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

I was really into her and we had a pretty good relationship. However, as I found out soon after we started dating, she\u2019s very, very anti-war. Like, hippie pacifist flower anti-war, almost.

She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal.

It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

My parents like him a lot, he\u2019s respectful to them, etc....until money comes in to play.\n\n**what happened**\n\nSo my parents are aware that my boyfriend is \u201cstingy\u201d as they call him. I\u2019m aware they\u2019re from a different generation which is why this is a huge red flag to them so I\u2019m trying to be understanding. The other day my boyfriend asks what i want to do for dinner, I said how about pizza delivery? He goes \u201cokay, just Venmo me half.\u201d\n\nMy mom calls me into the other room and goes \u201cwhy don\u2019t you stand up for yourself. He can pay for a f*cking pizza.\u201d I\u2019m like, he doesn\u2019t have to though. He\u2019s paying for his portion. She gets very frustrated and brings up the fact that he\u2019s staying with us, and a \u201cgentleman\u201d would do something in return for his hosts. My boyfriend does things around the house (cleans dishes, even washes the dog) but to her that\u2019s not \u201cceremonial\u201d enough. I\u2019m like, what\u2019s ceremonial about a pizza??? Is this really about you just wanting him to buy you dinner?\n\nSo my boyfriend walks in, evidently has heard at least half of this argument. He goes \u201cTo be frank, Mrs. H, while I appreciate you letting me stay with you, I don\u2019t owe your daughter anything. Especially not my money. We\u2019re both adults, and we can pay for ourselves. This is just something we\u2019ve worked out together.\u201d\n\nI took his side, and now my mom is convinced he doesn\u2019t value me, is disrespectful and \u201cdoesn\u2019t see the relationship going anywhere\u201d since he \u201cwon\u2019t invest\u201d. I told her that she\u2019s being ridiculous and that\u2019s not how my generation handles money. She\u2019s furious at both of us now.\n\nAITA?",

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me.

He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate. I have already spent near 2K on him in the last few months - digging through the little I have saved since I started working part time at age 14. \n\n\nAITA?

Then he says \"Hey, for you, no problem\"... it takes me back a small bit, but I wave it off and tell him not to trouble himself or his staff. Then he offers one of the pizza slice in the trays for free, and I say that sounds fair. Well I guess I misheard him as he then proceeds to fill up a whole box for me. I told him that was mighty generous giving that away for free and he says \"Hey, you're a very valued customer, I see you here all the time\"...\n\nThat's the part that really bummed me out.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers.

Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things.

In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate.

This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites.

She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby.

Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil.

Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers.

She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby.

Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil.

Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things.

My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

Each stamp has different monetary value (1 or 3 baht), and depending on how many stamps are collected, different products can be redeemed such as Doraemon lunchboxes or jugs or plushies.\n\nThis morning, my maid asked my mom if she had any stamps to give but I was asleep at that time. When I woke up, my parents have been asking me to give all my collected stamps (around 100 of them) to my maid. I refused because I put in the effort to collect those stamps. My parents told me I was being selfish because I didn't need the stamps anyways and the products that could be redeemed weren't useful to me either. They told me I should give my stamps to my maid, who would certainly benefit from them and make better use of.\n\nThe only reasons I collect the stamps are:\n\n* It gives me a feeling of satisfaction when I stick stamps on the collection sheet.\n* The products that could be redeemed are not useful to me, and if I do ever redeem anything - it would feel like something I \"earned\" rather than buying it.\n\nAITA for not wanting to give my maid the 7Eleven stamps I collected?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA when someone interrupts me when I am speaking, I continue to speak, over their words and louder |  \n\nAITA When I am out to dinner at a restaurant with my wife, daughter and son in law, my wife and SIL will routinely interrupt me when I am speaking.

She even told me about all her ex boyfriend's fetishes (like being into feet and other dudes etc) and that he was jealous that the two of us were hanging out. This worried me, and I told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with her airing out my dirty laundry under any circumstance, and specifically asked her to never do that. She obliged, but I still wasn't sure if I could trust her. So I made up a social test.\n\nI lied and told her I was into furries  (I'm not, though there's nothing wrong with people that are you do you) and I asked a friend of her's if she could help me test her by asking what my fetish is. She agreed, then went on to ask her when I wasn't around. I got a call back from her saying that the girl that I was seeing said I might be into furry creatures and stuff, and that she basically told her right away. So she failed. \n\nI did end up telling her that it was a test, but then she got furious with me. She thought it was unbelievable that I could betray her trust like that.

I was really into her and we had a pretty good relationship. However, as I found out soon after we started dating, she\u2019s very, very anti-war. Like, hippie pacifist flower anti-war, almost. Before I knew this, I hadn\u2019t talked to her about my service in the Marines, and I definitely wasn\u2019t looking forward to discussing it. \n\nI deployed to Iraq with 3rd Marines in 2004 and fought in Fallujah. Eventually, a month or two ago, we got to talking about what I was doing at that point in my life, and not wanting to cause conflict but also wanting to be truthful, I told her that I served in the Marines but never deployed. She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal. Apparently her sister told her that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with a liar\u201d so she broke up with me. \n\nAITA for not telling her the truth?\n\nEDIT: thanks for the input everybody. It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions.

He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft.

Each stamp has different monetary value (1 or 3 baht), and depending on how many stamps are collected, different products can be redeemed such as Doraemon lunchboxes or jugs or plushies.\n\nThis morning, my maid asked my mom if she had any stamps to give but I was asleep at that time. When I woke up, my parents have been asking me to give all my collected stamps (around 100 of them) to my maid. I refused because I put in the effort to collect those stamps. My parents told me I was being selfish because I didn't need the stamps anyways and the products that could be redeemed weren't useful to me either. They told me I should give my stamps to my maid, who would certainly benefit from them and make better use of.\n\nThe only reasons I collect the stamps are:\n\n* It gives me a feeling of satisfaction when I stick stamps on the collection sheet.\n* The products that could be redeemed are not useful to me, and if I do ever redeem anything - it would feel like something I \"earned\" rather than buying it.\n\nAITA for not wanting to give my maid the 7Eleven stamps I collected?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA when someone interrupts me when I am speaking, I continue to speak, over their words and louder |  \n\nAITA When I am out to dinner at a restaurant with my wife, daughter and son in law, my wife and SIL will routinely interrupt me when I am speaking.

This worried me, and I told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with her airing out my dirty laundry under any circumstance, and specifically asked her to never do that. She obliged, but I still wasn't sure if I could trust her. So I made up a social test.\n\nI lied and told her I was into furries  (I'm not, though there's nothing wrong with people that are you do you) and I asked a friend of her's if she could help me test her by asking what my fetish is. She agreed, then went on to ask her when I wasn't around. I got a call back from her saying that the girl that I was seeing said I might be into furry creatures and stuff, and that she basically told her right away. So she failed. \n\nI did end up telling her that it was a test, but then she got furious with me. She thought it was unbelievable that I could betray her trust like that.

My boyfriend saw it as well and wanted to go find a employe to report it, but I didn't wanna get involved and I also felt kinda sorry for the girl because she was shoplifting food and deodorant so I pressured him to drop it.  He argued but I insisted that we let it go, which he eventually agreed to, but later called me an asshole when we saw the girl walk out with her bagpack.

I was really into her and we had a pretty good relationship. However, as I found out soon after we started dating, she\u2019s very, very anti-war. Like, hippie pacifist flower anti-war, almost. Before I knew this, I hadn\u2019t talked to her about my service in the Marines, and I definitely wasn\u2019t looking forward to discussing it. \n\nI deployed to Iraq with 3rd Marines in 2004 and fought in Fallujah. Eventually, a month or two ago, we got to talking about what I was doing at that point in my life, and not wanting to cause conflict but also wanting to be truthful, I told her that I served in the Marines but never deployed. She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal. Apparently her sister told her that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with a liar\u201d so she broke up with me. \n\nAITA for not telling her the truth?\n\nEDIT: thanks for the input everybody. It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate.

Yep I am\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for taking away study notes from my partner who refused to help me write them? |  At the beginning of the year, my boyfriend and I began the same college courses. All of them were new to me, but he was retaking a few of them after dropping out about half-way through last semester.\n\nI began to write digital study notes on all of our lectures, and we both agreed to write them together and use them as a shared resource. We tried to see if this was a viable method we could be expected to keep up with, but unfortunately he couldn't handle the workload. Beyond that point, they became my personal notes that only I was writing. However, I didn't change the sharing permissions- so he could still access all of my notes at any time.\n\nSoon, all this recent stuff hit and our studying was converted to exclusively online. All of our tests and exams are now online and open-book, making my notes now especially useful- all we have to do is ctrl + f keywords to find the answers, barely any studying needed!\n\nNow when this happened, my partner very much struggled with the transition to online learning. I soon became the only one that was actually watching the online lectures, keeping track of the work that was due, and reminding him of deadlines. When it comes to tests for courses he hasn't done before, he relies entirely on my lecture notes to answer all the questions.\n\nNow, here's where the problem starts. I find the note-writing I do to be quite a large workload, and it imposes quite a bit of stress on me. Recently I've been struggling to complete them in time for the tests coming up in a few days, so I asked my partner if he could help me out by writing notes for a single course lecture.\n\nHis response was no, he wouldn't, because he didn't need my notes for that one course. When I told him that I write notes that he does need for other courses, and I'd appreciate some help and recognition for all the work I've been doing to help him out, he still refused. He expressed that he felt scared he wouldn't do them the right way, and I said I didn't care how they were formatted. Still, he refused.\n\nNow I felt really betrayed and used because of this. He has none of his own work he's been doing- he's with me all day, and all he does is play video games and barely get out of bed. He hasn't even said a single thanks once for all the work I've been doing to keep his grades afloat. He really seems to resent me at all suggesting that he's even slightly reliant upon me.\n\nSo I've finally decided to remove his access to my digital notes, leaving him completely stranded. He hasn't found out yet, and I suspect that he only will once he attempts the test in a few days. I feel a bit of guilt about it, and I don't know whether completely depriving him of that resource will cause him to fail. I also know that he suffers a lot with various illnesses like depression, and maybe he's been struggling with the workload because of it. AITA?\"\"\"",

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

Before I knew this, I hadn\u2019t talked to her about my service in the Marines, and I definitely wasn\u2019t looking forward to discussing it. \n\nI deployed to Iraq with 3rd Marines in 2004 and fought in Fallujah. Eventually, a month or two ago, we got to talking about what I was doing at that point in my life, and not wanting to cause conflict but also wanting to be truthful, I told her that I served in the Marines but never deployed. She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal. Apparently her sister told her that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with a liar\u201d so she broke up with me. \n\nAITA for not telling her the truth?\n\nEDIT: thanks for the input everybody. It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate. I have already spent near 2K on him in the last few months - digging through the little I have saved since I started working part time at age 14. \n\n\nAITA?

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate.

This is important.\n\nA few months before SS was released he met a gal (B) who worked at the facility and they became \"friendly\".  As a result, she was fired and he got transferred.  All of this happened about 6 weeks before SS's release date.  He was supposed to come home, here, until he met B.  When SS was released, he moved in with B and now they're engaged to be matried in June 2019.\n\n B comes from money, definitely upper upper middle class at least.  SS is was raised in the backwoods until age 14 and spent the next 12 years in prison.  Polar opposites but they make it work. I'm happy for him, really, but neither DH or I care much for B.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

When I woke up, my parents have been asking me to give all my collected stamps (around 100 of them) to my maid. I refused because I put in the effort to collect those stamps.

Each stamp has different monetary value (1 or 3 baht), and depending on how many stamps are collected, different products can be redeemed such as Doraemon lunchboxes or jugs or plushies.\n\nThis morning, my maid asked my mom if she had any stamps to give but I was asleep at that time. When I woke up, my parents have been asking me to give all my collected stamps (around 100 of them) to my maid. I refused because I put in the effort to collect those stamps. My parents told me I was being selfish because I didn't need the stamps anyways and the products that could be redeemed weren't useful to me either. They told me I should give my stamps to my maid, who would certainly benefit from them and make better use of.\n\nThe only reasons I collect the stamps are:\n\n* It gives me a feeling of satisfaction when I stick stamps on the collection sheet.\n* The products that could be redeemed are not useful to me, and if I do ever redeem anything - it would feel like something I \"earned\" rather than buying it.\n\nAITA for not wanting to give my maid the 7Eleven stamps I collected?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA when someone interrupts me when I am speaking, I continue to speak, over their words and louder |  \n\nAITA When I am out to dinner at a restaurant with my wife, daughter and son in law, my wife and SIL will routinely interrupt me when I am speaking.

She even told me about all her ex boyfriend's fetishes (like being into feet and other dudes etc) and that he was jealous that the two of us were hanging out. This worried me, and I told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with her airing out my dirty laundry under any circumstance, and specifically asked her to never do that. She obliged, but I still wasn't sure if I could trust her. So I made up a social test.\n\nI lied and told her I was into furries  (I'm not, though there's nothing wrong with people that are you do you) and I asked a friend of her's if she could help me test her by asking what my fetish is. She agreed, then went on to ask her when I wasn't around. I got a call back from her saying that the girl that I was seeing said I might be into furry creatures and stuff, and that she basically told her right away. So she failed. \n\nI did end up telling her that it was a test, but then she got furious with me. She thought it was unbelievable that I could betray her trust like that.

I was really into her and we had a pretty good relationship. However, as I found out soon after we started dating, she\u2019s very, very anti-war. Like, hippie pacifist flower anti-war, almost. Before I knew this, I hadn\u2019t talked to her about my service in the Marines, and I definitely wasn\u2019t looking forward to discussing it. \n\nI deployed to Iraq with 3rd Marines in 2004 and fought in Fallujah.

She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal. Apparently her sister told her that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with a liar\u201d so she broke up with me. \n\nAITA for not telling her the truth?\n\nEDIT: thanks for the input everybody. It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning.

He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft.

Yep I am\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for wanting two hours of daily time away from my baby? | I have cerebral palsy which gives me incredibly poor balance and I generally cannot walk without holding on to something and I use a rollator outside the house. Because of this, I knew before getting pregnant that I would need extra help, as I will not walk and carry my baby at the same time because there is a 100% chance that I will fall or drop her. So I arranged for my mother to move in with my boyfriend and me when I got pregnant, because her fixed-income housing got a new  landlord who constantly found reasons to raise rent, and when she moved out, he kept a $900 security deposit over replacing a patch of carpet. I told her to sue, but she \"didn't want to make waves\".\n\nSo my daughter, A, is six months old now, and I've learned my mother is very passive-aggressive. But the main thing I want to talk about is this: she kept all her friends and church in the old town, which is 45 minutes away, and goes back there for entire evenings (4-6 hours) about 3 to 4 nights a week. Sometimes, she turns her phone off, even. My boyfriend is a high school teacher, and thus has lesson planning, assignment making, and grading to do most evenings, resulting in about 2-3 hours of work an evening for him. He wants to help with the baby as much as he can, but he DOES have work to do, resulting in the fact that if Mom leaves, he effectively can't work until she gets back if A is having a bad evening due to acid reflux pain or constipation.\n\nAs A has gotten older, I've noticed my mother has started doing less and less to help with the baby. She's gone from doing 2-3 of the feedings a day to 1 or none. She'll do little things, like dress A and change some diapers.

Because of this, I knew before getting pregnant that I would need extra help, as I will not walk and carry my baby at the same time because there is a 100% chance that I will fall or drop her. So I arranged for my mother to move in with my boyfriend and me when I got pregnant, because her fixed-income housing got a new  landlord who constantly found reasons to raise rent, and when she moved out, he kept a $900 security deposit over replacing a patch of carpet. I told her to sue, but she \"didn't want to make waves\".\n\nSo my daughter, A, is six months old now, and I've learned my mother is very passive-aggressive. But the main thing I want to talk about is this: she kept all her friends and church in the old town, which is 45 minutes away, and goes back there for entire evenings (4-6 hours) about 3 to 4 nights a week. Sometimes, she turns her phone off, even. My boyfriend is a high school teacher, and thus has lesson planning, assignment making, and grading to do most evenings, resulting in about 2-3 hours of work an evening for him. He wants to help with the baby as much as he can, but he DOES have work to do, resulting in the fact that if Mom leaves, he effectively can't work until she gets back if A is having a bad evening due to acid reflux pain or constipation.\n\nAs A has gotten older, I've noticed my mother has started doing less and less to help with the baby. She's gone from doing 2-3 of the feedings a day to 1 or none. She'll do little things, like dress A and change some diapers. But I no longer trust my mom to bathe her, as she'll do so in the baby tub sling A has outgrown and that's unsafe.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby.

Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil.

Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby.

Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil.

Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

She brings home about $50,000/year and I bring home about $75,000. We're both in our early 30s and have been together for almost ten years now. We're in a comfortable situation financially.\n\nAlright, let's begin with what my wife and I have found to be the bitter truth: she just does not like being a pharmacist. She absolutely hates it. Day after day she'll come home with a new complaint about something a patient or colleague did. One time a patient crumpled up a receipt and told her to throw it away. One time a patient pissed all over the toilet seat. One time a patient licked his fingers before counting money and handed the bills to her.\n\nOne of the more oddball stories was a patient grilled her for two hours on whether or not the eyedrops she had received might have shards of glass in them, and when my wife eventually said \"OK, why don't you just call the number on the box and ask their helpline?\" the patient blew up and called corporate to file a formal complaint.\n\nSo a few months ago, we decided that maybe just dealing with customers kind of sucked. I'd been there and could relate. I asked if she would try working in a hospital (no direct contact with patients), and she agreed to try it out. She has worked there a month now, and the only thing that has changed is the nature of her complaints. She doesn't like her boss and she doesn't like her immediate supervisor. She doesn't like how busy it is there. She actually probably hates it more than her old job because at least in her old pharmacy, she could take a break every so often.\n\nA lot of her complaints are valid. Some of them seem a bit ridiculous--things that have happened to me and didn't even blip on my radar. I think most of it stems from the fact that, again, she really just doesn't like being a pharmacist.\n\nSo at this point we have basically tried all career avenues of pharmacy, and nothing is quite doing it for her. She wants to get into something else. I've repeatedly told her that I would be supportive of her career change if she thought it would make her happier, and she frequently seeks permission from me.\n\nLast Sunday, she suddenly came to me and said she wanted to be an esthetician at a women's spa. This wasn't exactly the most surprising thing in the world, as I know my wife loves beauty products/skincare related fields, but ... an esthetician? I mean absolutely no disrespect to estheticians as I know it's a job that requires a hell of a lot more than what I do at mine, but I can already hear her complaints about future customers. \n\nOf course this is a huge step for my wife. She is horrible at making decisions. I don't want to squash her dreams, as she seems really enthusiastic about this, but I have a really strong feeling that she's making a classic mistake. It's like loving Disneyland so much that you decide to work there, and all of a sudden you're stacking boxes in the back of the gift shop. I feel like her reasons for going into this career are all wrong and that we're going to be back in the same spot in a year, just with a whole lot of new problems and another job thrown into the \"not for me\" pile. And in the time, she will be taking a fairly massive salary hit. I agreed to support us, and I know I can, but the job offer she has is not offering her all that much at all.\n\nI'm honestly inclined to just start bringing up doubts about it, but knowing her personality, she would probably just give up on it. She actually seems excited to work there though and while I don't want to make her feel bad, but I really want to get this off my chest. I'm going against what I promised her, but I have serious doubts about this career choice for her. I'm frankly against the idea and want to tell her but feel like IWBTA. \n\n\"\"\"",

It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate.

She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me.

She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things.

She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal.

It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself.

At first, I listed with a starting bid at 325 dollars with a \"buy it now\" option at 465 dollars. If you\u2019re not familiar with eBay, the \"buy it now\" option enables you to instantaneously buy the item for the price, without having to wait for the auction to end.\n\nThere were some bids that went to 340. One of the bidders messages me saying that \"I know I'm breaking the rules, but can you sell it to me for 400 now? I need to use it soon.\" I said that the best I could do was 450, and he says he's fine with it.\n\nI took some more time to think about the offer. I did some research, and I saw that the model generally sells at more than 500 dollars. I realized that because of the way it was listed, the camera will not sell for more than 465, despite the fact that I initially expected a possibility of selling it for more than 465 dollars, which meant that I was going to lose out on the sale. So, I ended the auction and restarted it, setting the initial bid at 450 dollars without a \"buy it now\" option.\n\nThis is what I sent him, word by word: \"Sorry, after some research I decided to list it at a higher price. You can still bid and I'll send you a vintage lens and an adaptor as an apology if you win, but if not I wish you good luck with other sellers. If you need to use it urgently, I recommend you rent one.\"\n\nHere is what he sent. There seems to be a typo there, but I'm not sure what it is meant to be:\"Nah that\u2019s just messed up man.

At first, I listed with a starting bid at 325 dollars with a \"buy it now\" option at 465 dollars. If you\u2019re not familiar with eBay, the \"buy it now\" option enables you to instantaneously buy the item for the price, without having to wait for the auction to end.\n\nThere were some bids that went to 340. One of the bidders messages me saying that \"I know I'm breaking the rules, but can you sell it to me for 400 now? I need to use it soon.\" I said that the best I could do was 450, and he says he's fine with it.\n\nI took some more time to think about the offer. I did some research, and I saw that the model generally sells at more than 500 dollars. I realized that because of the way it was listed, the camera will not sell for more than 465, despite the fact that I initially expected a possibility of selling it for more than 465 dollars, which meant that I was going to lose out on the sale. So, I ended the auction and restarted it, setting the initial bid at 450 dollars without a \"buy it now\" option.\n\nThis is what I sent him, word by word: \"Sorry, after some research I decided to list it at a higher price. You can still bid and I'll send you a vintage lens and an adaptor as an apology if you win, but if not I wish you good luck with other sellers. If you need to use it urgently, I recommend you rent one.\"\n\nHere is what he sent. There seems to be a typo there, but I'm not sure what it is meant to be:\"Nah that\u2019s just messed up man. I\u2019m not gonna but someone that makes an excuse to resist the item to make some more money. No thanks\"\n\nAm I the asshole?",

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.\nMy boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.\n\n*Edit 4\nYes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.\n\nSaying that I think I will break up with him soon.\nI say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him\n\n*Edit 5\nMy last edit sounded way worse than I intended. \nI said I think I will, I didn\u2019t say when. I don\u2019t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can\u2019t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I\u2019ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate.

What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers.

Each stamp has different monetary value (1 or 3 baht), and depending on how many stamps are collected, different products can be redeemed such as Doraemon lunchboxes or jugs or plushies.\n\nThis morning, my maid asked my mom if she had any stamps to give but I was asleep at that time. When I woke up, my parents have been asking me to give all my collected stamps (around 100 of them) to my maid. I refused because I put in the effort to collect those stamps. My parents told me I was being selfish because I didn't need the stamps anyways and the products that could be redeemed weren't useful to me either. They told me I should give my stamps to my maid, who would certainly benefit from them and make better use of.\n\nThe only reasons I collect the stamps are:\n\n* It gives me a feeling of satisfaction when I stick stamps on the collection sheet.\n* The products that could be redeemed are not useful to me, and if I do ever redeem anything - it would feel like something I \"earned\" rather than buying it.\n\nAITA for not wanting to give my maid the 7Eleven stamps I collected?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA when someone interrupts me when I am speaking, I continue to speak, over their words and louder |  \n\nAITA When I am out to dinner at a restaurant with my wife, daughter and son in law, my wife and SIL will routinely interrupt me when I am speaking.

She even told me about all her ex boyfriend's fetishes (like being into feet and other dudes etc) and that he was jealous that the two of us were hanging out. This worried me, and I told her that I wouldn't be comfortable with her airing out my dirty laundry under any circumstance, and specifically asked her to never do that. She obliged, but I still wasn't sure if I could trust her. So I made up a social test.\n\nI lied and told her I was into furries  (I'm not, though there's nothing wrong with people that are you do you) and I asked a friend of her's if she could help me test her by asking what my fetish is. She agreed, then went on to ask her when I wasn't around. I got a call back from her saying that the girl that I was seeing said I might be into furry creatures and stuff, and that she basically told her right away. So she failed. \n\nI did end up telling her that it was a test, but then she got furious with me. She thought it was unbelievable that I could betray her trust like that. She still wanted to see me but I needed a break.

My boyfriend and I were grocery shopping at a big supermarket. When we were standing in the cosmetics aisle I saw a 12-13 year old girl put deodorant in her backpack. I could also see that she had other stuff in there, cereal and and grapes. She wasn't very inconspicuous but it's a huge supermarket so I guess nobody noticed. My boyfriend saw it as well and wanted to go find a employe to report it, but I didn't wanna get involved and I also felt kinda sorry for the girl because she was shoplifting food and deodorant so I pressured him to drop it.  He argued but I insisted that we let it go, which he eventually agreed to, but later called me an asshole when we saw the girl walk out with her bagpack. He was mad about it saying that the employees will get in trouble for the missing stuff. Was I the asshole?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not being honest with my (now ex) girlfriend about my military service? | Throwaway because she uses reddit. \n\n\nI recently broke up with a girl who I had been dating for a couple months. I was really into her and we had a pretty good relationship. However, as I found out soon after we started dating, she\u2019s very, very anti-war. Like, hippie pacifist flower anti-war, almost. Before I knew this, I hadn\u2019t talked to her about my service in the Marines, and I definitely wasn\u2019t looking forward to discussing it. \n\nI deployed to Iraq with 3rd Marines in 2004 and fought in Fallujah. Eventually, a month or two ago, we got to talking about what I was doing at that point in my life, and not wanting to cause conflict but also wanting to be truthful, I told her that I served in the Marines but never deployed. She was a little upset that I didn\u2019t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn\u2019t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should\u2019ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal. Apparently her sister told her that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t be in a relationship with a liar\u201d so she broke up with me. \n\nAITA for not telling her the truth?\n\nEDIT: thanks for the input everybody. It was definitely an asshole move and I\u2019ll try to be more conscientious in the future. \"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for leaving dead animals on my neighbours doorstep? | I'm new to reddit so please bear with me. \n\nI [35F] currently live in a maisonette/duplex apartment. What attracted me to it is the fact that it has a rather sizeable back garden, which is ideal for me as I have two dogs and it gives them lots of space to run around and play etc. The garden is shared with three of the neighbours, and until recently that was absolutely fine as we all got along great and so did our animals. \n\n6 months ago, a new neighbour moved in two doors down from me. She has a cat which, honestly, is a fucking dickhead. It has a habit of knocking over the water bowl which is left out for my dogs and it has scratched my other neighbour's chihuahua across his face three times, and he's now afraid to go and play in the garden. It also doesn't like small children, which is an issue as one of the neighbours has an 18month old toddler and I have a 5month old baby. It's yet to bite or scratch either of them, but it hisses and growls at both of them constantly. \n\nNow, here's the problem. This cat is a killing machine. Birds, mice, frogs, voles... you name it, this thing will have it. I understand that's part of a cat's natural instinct, but the problem is that the thing keeps bringing its kills into my house. I usually leave the back door open while I'm home so the dogs can come and go between the house and garden as they wish, and the cat kept bringing in dead or nearly dead creatures and just leaving them in the middle of my kitchen. This was obviously an issue for me, as, aside from being unhygienic, my dogs would get at them when they had god knows what diseases and parasites. I also became concerned because my baby  is not far from crawling and I would hate for her to be messing with stuff like that. I began closing the door, which upset my dogs a bit but was kind of a necessary evil. The cat started leaving stuff on my backstep, which in a way was worse because I'd often step on them when I was going outside (have you ever stepped on a dead pigeon in sliders? Horribly unpleasant). \n\nI've brought up with the neighbour that her cat keeps doing this and that she ought to keep it inside or at least put a bell on its collar so it has a harder time killing things. She refused to do either, stating she thought both collars and confining a cat indoors are \"cruel\". My solution since then has simply been to shovel up whatever dead things her cat leaves outside my door and dump them outside of hers. I think this is justified, and it'll hopefully get the message across, but a friend of mine says she thinks it's petty and arseholey and I should continue just disposing of the dead things like I was previously.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for selling my boyfriends xbox/games to pay his rent? | Throwaway account.\n\nLast week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for \u00a3400.\n\nI did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. \n\nI work a part time job while studying because my student loans don\u2019t cover the cost of living. \n\nMeanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.\n\nLast week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn\u2019t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. \n\nI do feel guilty but I\u2019m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?\n\n\n*Edit 1 \nWhy didn\u2019t I communicate like an adult?\n \nI tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can\u2019t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. \nEvery single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.\nIt was always a case of \u2018yeah yeah I\u2019ll start looking tomorrow\u2019 or \u2018yeah I know\u2019 \u2018yeah\u2019.\nHe never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. \n\nI felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would\u2019ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. \n\n*Edit 2 \nWhy didn\u2019t you just let him get evicted?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to become homeless. He isn\u2019t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.\n\n*Edit 3\nI know what I did was illegal and theft.
