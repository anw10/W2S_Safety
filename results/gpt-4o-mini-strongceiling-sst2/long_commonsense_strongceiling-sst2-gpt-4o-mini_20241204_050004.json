We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I\u2019m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me. I\u2019m thinking about just telling the director EVERYTHING and have her be his problem. \n\n\nWIBTA\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s her day off today and I\u2019m looking through her files to see if she put my name on any. Well her deadline is tomorrow and has gotten barely anything done. She just has a sketch and yes she put my name on it. So instead of finishing my work that\u2019s due Friday, I have to rush to do hers. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m guaranteed to get in trouble.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are? | I do Jiu Jitsu, have been for the past 5 years. For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week. So, AITA for disagreeing with our HR?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app? | Found out my girlfriend reinstalled tinder at her best friends bachelorette party 3ish months ago and hid it from me. She still had the app on her phone,  and would browse it. Had an updated picture and profile and blocked my account. Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way. Was suprised to get off work and see so many comments and votes. Really does help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my child about his dad? | I was with Michael for 8 months, after breaking up I found out I was pregnant.\n\nMichael was around every day for those 9 months \n\nWhen our son was born Michael paid child support, he always paid extra.\n\nMichael was around for the first 3 years until I met my husband.\n\nWe both agreed it would be better for our son to have a normal family.\n\nMichael was studying to get his doctorate at that time.\n\nLast I heard Michael had gotten married and has two daughters.\n\n\n\nMichael paid  support up until 4 years ago.\n\nMy son is now 24.\n\nWe recently made the choice to tell him about Michael.\n\nHe hasn't spoken to us since.\n\nETA; Michael isn't around anymore, he passed away about 3 years ago, idk how \n\n\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church? | My family is all Catholic and I'm from an almost all Irish family. Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"I added extra onion to the soup, knowing she was allergic to it.\"\"\"",

Meeting him at the door when he comes home for work? Can't say \"hey!\" because he gets upset. Why? Because he says it's rude. Tells me it's disrespectful.\n\nI am not yelling HEY! to get his attention. I'm using it to greet him and use a friendly tone.\n\nIn the 3 decades I've used the word, not a single person has ever been offended by it, or at least never bothered to tell me it was offensive. I've googled it, and nothing suggests it's disrespectful. In fact, most people seem to use it when greeting someone who's known more intimately than just an acquaintance. Growing up, it was used all the time. \n\nBut he insists I'm rude.\n\nAITA for using the word \"Hey?\"",

They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane.

I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid.

Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent.

Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego.

I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

She still had the app on her phone,  and would browse it. Had an updated picture and profile and blocked my account. Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way.

Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area.

Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part.

She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house.

No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent.

Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego.

Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us.

My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid.

Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher.

They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for asking my GF to wear shoes to breakfast? | AITA. Me (23M) and my girlfriend (23F) went on our first holiday together. Unfortunately, we had a small argument regarding wearing shoes to the breakfast buffet at the hotel.\n\nIt all started as we were leaving our room to go to the breakfast restaurant and I noticed she was not wearing any shoes. I asked her to put some on.\n\nShe refused, claiming that nobody else cares if she wears or doesn't wear shoes. Obviously, she got more frustrated by me demanding that she do something (we are both pretty stubborn people).\n\nI find that going to a breakfast restaurant without any shoes (just socks) quite disrespectful to the property, to the staff and to the other clients. The establishment has made an effort to keep the breakfast lounge clean, replenish food/drink and waiter for us; I feel the least we can do is come fully dressed. I also feel like it brings unwarranted attention to her (and to me), which I really don't like.\n\nHer argument is that I am being silly and it's perfectly reasonable to go without shoes to the buffet. She suggested I was being too 'posh'. My girlfriend also doesn't think that anyone will notice or care enough, if they do notice. But I beg to differ. \n\nThe argument escalated to the point we're I decided I rather not go down to breakfast and I will just eat some of the snacks we bought from the supermarket the day before. I don't really get angry, and wouldn't let this ruin our holiday. Basically, I didnt  hold a grudge for missing breakfast and continued the day as if it hadn't happened.\n\nThis is all in the past and we are doing very well right now. But this was a small blip in our relationship and I wanted a second opinion, do I need to get over myself? Is it a bit odd to go to a restaurant shoeless? \n\nThank you.\"\"\"",

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template.

The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area.

Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well).

She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.).

I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus.

He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus.

He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well).

We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I\u2019m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me. I\u2019m thinking about just telling the director EVERYTHING and have her be his problem. \n\n\nWIBTA\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s her day off today and I\u2019m looking through her files to see if she put my name on any. Well her deadline is tomorrow and has gotten barely anything done. She just has a sketch and yes she put my name on it. So instead of finishing my work that\u2019s due Friday, I have to rush to do hers. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m guaranteed to get in trouble.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are? | I do Jiu Jitsu, have been for the past 5 years. For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week. So, AITA for disagreeing with our HR?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app? | Found out my girlfriend reinstalled tinder at her best friends bachelorette party 3ish months ago and hid it from me. She still had the app on her phone,  and would browse it. Had an updated picture and profile and blocked my account. Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way. Was suprised to get off work and see so many comments and votes. Really does help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my child about his dad? | I was with Michael for 8 months, after breaking up I found out I was pregnant.\n\nMichael was around every day for those 9 months \n\nWhen our son was born Michael paid child support, he always paid extra.\n\nMichael was around for the first 3 years until I met my husband.\n\nWe both agreed it would be better for our son to have a normal family.\n\nMichael was studying to get his doctorate at that time.\n\nLast I heard Michael had gotten married and has two daughters.\n\n\n\nMichael paid  support up until 4 years ago.\n\nMy son is now 24.\n\nWe recently made the choice to tell him about Michael.\n\nHe hasn't spoken to us since.\n\nETA; Michael isn't around anymore, he passed away about 3 years ago, idk how \n\n\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church? | My family is all Catholic and I'm from an almost all Irish family. Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue.

One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for getting a dog without telling my husband? | This past weekend some friends and I went shopping and stopped by this petstore in this dilapidated strip mall.

It was probably a combination of the mimosas we had earlier + the cuteness of the puppies but I ultimately agreed to buy one of the dogs because I couldn't stand the thought of it being put down. \n\nWhen my husband got home later that night he was furious that I had spent so much on a new puppy without telling him. He told me I was probably duped by that store and I don't disagree, but I also believe I did the right thing bringing that puppy away from that horrid store. He is mad that I did all this without asking him and I did apologize but I feel like he should cut me some slack. I only acted out of compassion and was just a bit overwhelmed by what that store manager was telling me. And besides, getting a cute puppy is hardly the worst thing to happen to anyone.

Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher.

They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA first this prank I pulled? | My first time here so sorry if this breaks any rules or anything.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

Timmy was noticeably creeped out, but I told him that he didn't have anything else to worry about since he was a good kid. We bid him goodnight and we hung out for a little while longer, but then Timmy starts screaming. We rush into his room and he's pointing outside his window...at a streetlight.

My girlfriend told me that it was probably for the best if I left and I agreed.\n\nWell, this morning I got called to my girlfriend's house and her parents and aunt and uncle were waiting for me and they didn't look happy. They asked if I told him a scary story about the Bunyin and I said yes. They told me that the story caused Timmy to flee the house early in the morning and they couldn't find him anywhere nearby. They were about to report him missing when one of their neighbors came by with Timmy in his car and he brought him home when he saw him running down the street. I immediately felt guilty about that part and my girlfriend's uncle was really letting me have it. He starts telling me that it would've been all my fault had Timmy been abducted while running away. I argued that Timmy wanted me to tell him a scary story in the first place, but they didn't want to hear it.

We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I\u2019m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me. I\u2019m thinking about just telling the director EVERYTHING and have her be his problem. \n\n\nWIBTA\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s her day off today and I\u2019m looking through her files to see if she put my name on any. Well her deadline is tomorrow and has gotten barely anything done. She just has a sketch and yes she put my name on it. So instead of finishing my work that\u2019s due Friday, I have to rush to do hers. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m guaranteed to get in trouble.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are? | I do Jiu Jitsu, have been for the past 5 years. For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week. So, AITA for disagreeing with our HR?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app? | Found out my girlfriend reinstalled tinder at her best friends bachelorette party 3ish months ago and hid it from me. She still had the app on her phone,  and would browse it. Had an updated picture and profile and blocked my account. Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way. Was suprised to get off work and see so many comments and votes. Really does help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my child about his dad? | I was with Michael for 8 months, after breaking up I found out I was pregnant.\n\nMichael was around every day for those 9 months \n\nWhen our son was born Michael paid child support, he always paid extra.\n\nMichael was around for the first 3 years until I met my husband.\n\nWe both agreed it would be better for our son to have a normal family.\n\nMichael was studying to get his doctorate at that time.\n\nLast I heard Michael had gotten married and has two daughters.\n\n\n\nMichael paid  support up until 4 years ago.\n\nMy son is now 24.\n\nWe recently made the choice to tell him about Michael.\n\nHe hasn't spoken to us since.\n\nETA; Michael isn't around anymore, he passed away about 3 years ago, idk how \n\n\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church? | My family is all Catholic and I'm from an almost all Irish family. Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting my son to stay with his dad and his soon to be step - mom? | Hello everyone!\n\nI'm a year and a half into my divorce of a husband who I spent 10 years with. It's not finalized yet and we've been sharing custody of our son (6). We divorced due to him cheating with me mutable times with a family friend, he intends to marry now. I've never allowed my own feelings and humiliation damage my son's relationship with his dad. We are both mature between drop ups and picks up, re - scheduling and managing the financial part and have never fought. I've never bad mouthed him, or even mention him around my son despite feelings I'm working through because I know how impressionable he is.\n\nThe issue raised though when ex's fiance moved in with her 2 children. She and I use to be close friends, but obviously have no relationship at the moment. I know she speaks badly about me and repeated private things I once confided in my ex husband about to other friends and her older children. Word gets around. Recently my son has been returning home repeating foul language and asked me the definition of words, such as whore, c\\*nt, insane etc. When I ask where he picked that vocab up, he says she was saying that what dad's fiance calls you. He then started talking about a swimming pool and mentioned about me going 'into' the deep end. I asked him what he meant about that. He told me again, dad's fiance was saying you going into the deep end, which I assume he meant to say going off the deep end. He asked me if I was going anywhere which I replied no. He mentioned that didn't make sense because she said you're going to leave me after they have the wedding because you'll be too sad.\n\nI will admit, once I realized about the affair I became incredibly depressed and was needing a great deal of therapy so my son spent more time at his father's new place. I really didn't want him to see me like that. Both ex and his fiance became aware of what was going on. I've been doing much better now with the right medication and support, which ex is aware of as well. Perhaps my son is just misphrasing, but I feel like his future step mom is saying things she should about me and I really don't want him over there if she's involved. I haven't messaged my ex, I intend to speak to him in person tomorrow. Would I be the AITA if I asked him to stop having her around him unsupervised?\n\nAlso throwaway because I'm ashamed asking and admitting this I couldn't do it on my regular account.\"\"\"",

Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue.

We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well).

Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue.

No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid.

Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office.

Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego.

Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us.

I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid.

        "model_response": "\"**WIBTA if I snitch to my boss, that my nice coworker isn\u2019t doing her job?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**  \nReason: The coworker's lack of performance is affecting your work and the team's overall productivity. You have tried to address the issue directly with her, and it has not improved. Reporting the situation to your boss is a reasonable step to take.\n\n\"**AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**  \nReason: While it's understandable to want to teach beginners a lesson, your approach may come off as aggressive and disrespectful. It's important to foster a supportive environment in martial arts, especially for those who are just starting out.\n\n\"**AITA for disagreeing with our HR?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**  \nReason: It's reasonable to voice your concerns about HR's handling of ID cards and office discipline. You and your colleagues are justified in wanting to address the shortcomings of HR.\n\n\"**AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**  \nReason: Trust is essential in a relationship, and your feelings about her using a dating app in secret are valid. It's important to communicate your boundaries and expectations.\n\n\"**AITA for not telling my child about his dad?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**  \nReason: It's important for children to know their family history, even if the relationship with the father has changed. Keeping this information from your child can lead to feelings of betrayal or confusion.\n\n\"**AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**  \nReason: It's important to allow your daughter to explore her beliefs and friendships. Forbidding her from attending another church may create resentment and hinder her personal growth.\n\n\"**AITA for not telling my boss I live near the 'projects'?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**  \nReason: You were not asked about your living situation, and you did not feel it was a safety issue. The mother's reaction seems excessive, and you should not feel obligated to disclose your living arrangements.\n\n\"**AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**  \nReason: It's not appropriate to shame someone for trying to assist another customer. If you had concerns about the service, it would have been better to address them calmly rather than confront the cashier in a rude manner.\n\n\"**I swung a hatchet at my best friend James.**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**  \nReason: Violence is never an acceptable solution to a disagreement. It's important to find peaceful ways to resolve conflicts, and swinging a hatchet at someone is not one of them.",

She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

She still had the app on her phone,  and would browse it. Had an updated picture and profile and blocked my account. Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way. Was suprised to get off work and see so many comments and votes. Really does help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my child about his dad? | I was with Michael for 8 months, after breaking up I found out I was pregnant.\n\nMichael was around every day for those 9 months \n\nWhen our son was born Michael paid child support, he always paid extra.\n\nMichael was around for the first 3 years until I met my husband.\n\nWe both agreed it would be better for our son to have a normal family.\n\nMichael was studying to get his doctorate at that time.\n\nLast I heard Michael had gotten married and has two daughters.\n\n\n\nMichael paid  support up until 4 years ago.\n\nMy son is now 24.\n\nWe recently made the choice to tell him about Michael.\n\nHe hasn't spoken to us since.\n\nETA; Michael isn't around anymore, he passed away about 3 years ago, idk how \n\n\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church? | My family is all Catholic and I'm from an almost all Irish family. Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

I buy maybe five new items of clothing each year, I don\u2019t eat fast food, and I\u2019m used to putting away hundreds of dollars in savings each month.\n\nWe both had full time jobs with comparable pay and John had a side job as well. We decided to combine our full time income that we budgeted together and agreed that John could use his side income for whatever he wanted, so that usually went to food and clothes (things we budgeted for together, but not enough for his lifestyle in his opinion). He\u2019d often blow through our joint money too, but I tried to be patient with him since I knew we both weren\u2019t used to having our spending affect someone else. \n\nI took out cash for something and ended up with $10 leftover. I told John and he said I should treat myself with that. I got excited because I seriously never got to spend money on myself and decided I just wanted a chocolate milkshake with it.

I don\u2019t think anything of it until I go to order and John places an order for a full meal and more.

I got upset because he eats out every day so this was normal for him, but a milkshake was supposed to be special for me. He got angry at me and called me ungrateful. I retaliated and yelled at him for not just letting me have my own thing for once.

Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area.

Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part.

I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue.

No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well).

Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher.

She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well).

Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego.

Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part.

I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house.

No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well).

Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego.

Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for assuming someone went to rehab for drugs? | So the other night I was at my SO\u2019s work party and one of the guys brought his new girlfriend.

We all start breaking off into smaller groups having different conversations, and I start talking to 2 of the techs, one of whom is the one with the new girlfriend. A few minutes into the conversation the girlfriend walks up and I end up chatting with her and I ask her what she does for work.\n\nShe tells me she is a real estate agent but that she\u2019s been out of work for a little while because she was in rehab. \n\nI was kind of taken aback that she was so open about something like that with people she just met but hey, some people are just like that. Good for her for getting clean, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be proud of that too. That\u2019s pretty much my entire thought process on this.

We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I\u2019m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me. I\u2019m thinking about just telling the director EVERYTHING and have her be his problem. \n\n\nWIBTA\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s her day off today and I\u2019m looking through her files to see if she put my name on any. Well her deadline is tomorrow and has gotten barely anything done. She just has a sketch and yes she put my name on it. So instead of finishing my work that\u2019s due Friday, I have to rush to do hers. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m guaranteed to get in trouble.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are? | I do Jiu Jitsu, have been for the past 5 years. For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR.

Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus.

Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office.

Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well).

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid.

We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I\u2019m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me. I\u2019m thinking about just telling the director EVERYTHING and have her be his problem. \n\n\nWIBTA\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s her day off today and I\u2019m looking through her files to see if she put my name on any. Well her deadline is tomorrow and has gotten barely anything done. She just has a sketch and yes she put my name on it. So instead of finishing my work that\u2019s due Friday, I have to rush to do hers. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m guaranteed to get in trouble.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are? | I do Jiu Jitsu, have been for the past 5 years. For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again.

This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane.

Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling my FWB/baby mama that she doesn't just \"deserve\" a child? | This may sound worse than it is. I've been sort of friends/ acquaintances with this woman (we'll call her Nikki) on and off for...decades, honestly. She's never been mentally stable in the entire time I knew her, but she has a job and everything. We have some mutual friends, but I don't speak to them much. She's a few years older than me, and we're both in our 30s.\n\nWe ended up reconnecting about 7 months ago and we ended up having a short fling. FWIW, I used a condom and didn't ask her about birth control. Lo and behold, she gets pregnant and is about 5 months along now. I assumed she'd do what any rational person would do and terminate. We don't know each other that well and when we did, things were often very hostile. We fell out of contact and remained Facebook friends this time.\n\nNope. Nikki is THRILLED. She ended up announcing on Facebook first, not even telling me directly first. It was a rehashing of her previous family life and how it ended tragically, and how she's excited for a new start and she's so grateful that the universe gave her this gift. Turns out, a lot of her friends and family agreed with this. All of the comments were along the lines of expressing happiness and that she deserves this after all the suffering she's been through. Apparently, she'd been married before, over a decade ago, and lost both her son as a baby and her husband right after.\n\nI messaged her that she needs to be rational about this, that we don't know each other or get along, that I never agreed to have a child with her and that nobody \"deserves\" a baby at any cost. She sent me a curt response that just said that I was tainting her happiness and stressing her out, and immediately blocked me from messenger, but I can still see her Facebook (although I'm sure that will change). \n\nI left a comment after that was just \"What?? PM me\". She didn't respond, but a friend she'd obviously told about everything did, calling me an asshole and that I needed to leave her alone because I \"didn't understand\".\n\nI don't know what I'm going to do if this child is mine, but am I really the asshole for saying that a child not wanted by both parents shouldn't be born?\"\"\"",

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I\u2019m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me. I\u2019m thinking about just telling the director EVERYTHING and have her be his problem. \n\n\nWIBTA\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s her day off today and I\u2019m looking through her files to see if she put my name on any. Well her deadline is tomorrow and has gotten barely anything done. She just has a sketch and yes she put my name on it. So instead of finishing my work that\u2019s due Friday, I have to rush to do hers.

I need a break and have a life outside of this \u201cpart time \u201c job!\n\n\nSo a few days ago I do an on call shift . At my job the moment you clock into on call you are paid regardless . If you are on call 8AM-6PM, you are paid 10 hours even if you were only called in for 1. I called him and reminded him I am working on call Saturday . He agreed and said he would note that in my portal. I got called in for a 2 hour shift. I called Monday to clarify that I get my 10 hours and he says no I \u201cpicked up a shift I was not on call\u201d\nI lost it . I got bat crazy and tell him I need my extra 8 hours. I cleared my day on call waiting to get called in and got called in. Picking up a shift would be me calling in before or getting a choice to go in. I complained to HR , he was scolded and I got my full 10 hours and an extra 2 as well as a bonus. They apologized . A few weeks later he was pulled from scheduling to another position as they said a lot of people have had issues with him\nIn the scheduling section of the office. I still feel bad though. I feel like I tipped the cup over. AITA?",

Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent.

Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night.

He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not wanting my mom to sue my dad for child support? | \nTLDR; dying father owes mom child support.

I\u2019ll admit my dad has been an asshole in the past, but they\u2019ve always had a custody agreement. We would visit my dad most weekends and in between he would call and send cute letters and stuff. He has some issues such as temperament but it\u2019s because when he was younger he got thyroid cancer after serving in the Air Force and they removed his whole thyroid and his meds don\u2019t help a lot with keeping his hormones in balance. \n\nAnyways, he didn\u2019t pay a lot of child support when I was growing up because he\u2019s always been extremely poor. Not only that, but my mom had a huge problem with accruing debt. We lived with my grandma growing up and she would take out credit cards in my grandmas name, max them out, and then not pay them. She\u2019d also buy a ton of clothes with the money that was supposed to go to bills, so occasionally our water or electricity would get shut off. So he didn\u2019t want her to spend all that money on herself instead of us girls. \n\nA couple years ago she got my grandmas ( moms mom) house that we had lived in since I was 3 foreclosed on, even though it had a reverse mortgage. She didn\u2019t have to pay on the mortgage all those years, she just wouldn\u2019t pay the property tax until eventually they wanted a ton of money and she didn\u2019t have it so it got foreclosed. \n\nSo now, my dad has been diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer. He\u2019s making all of his death arrangements while he\u2019s been going through treatment.  \n\nMy mom told me that because my grandma on my dads side is so rich (and she also has stage 4 cancer in her breasts that metastasized to lungs and lymph nodes)  she\u2019s going to try to take the money my dad owes her out of his inheritance from my grandma. \n\nI\u2019m upset because not only is she trying to go after my dying father and grandmother, she would be taking the money that my dad was going to leave to my sister and I. I know it\u2019s shitty that he didn\u2019t pay his child support all the way but he\u2019s been sending her $20 a month because that\u2019s all he has now and he didn\u2019t want to give it to her just for her to spend it on herself instead of us and the bills because she was doing a shitty job of taking care of us. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be a spoiled brat and say \u201cthat\u2019s my money!!\u201d Because it\u2019s not, but she\u2019s trying to go after my dying father and grandmother that I love a lot.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way. Was suprised to get off work and see so many comments and votes. Really does help.\"\"\"\n\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my child about his dad? | I was with Michael for 8 months, after breaking up I found out I was pregnant.\n\nMichael was around every day for those 9 months \n\nWhen our son was born Michael paid child support, he always paid extra.\n\nMichael was around for the first 3 years until I met my husband.\n\nWe both agreed it would be better for our son to have a normal family.\n\nMichael was studying to get his doctorate at that time.\n\nLast I heard Michael had gotten married and has two daughters.\n\nMichael paid support up until 4 years ago.\n\nMy son is now 24.\n\nWe recently made the choice to tell him about Michael.\n\nHe hasn't spoken to us since.\n\nETA; Michael isn't around anymore, he passed away about 3 years ago, idk how \n\nAITA?\"\"\"\n\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church? | My family is all Catholic and I'm from an almost all Irish family. Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\n\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\n\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN

We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I\u2019m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me. I\u2019m thinking about just telling the director EVERYTHING and have her be his problem. \n\n\nWIBTA\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s her day off today and I\u2019m looking through her files to see if she put my name on any. Well her deadline is tomorrow and has gotten barely anything done. She just has a sketch and yes she put my name on it. So instead of finishing my work that\u2019s due Friday, I have to rush to do hers. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m guaranteed to get in trouble.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are? | I do Jiu Jitsu, have been for the past 5 years. For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week. So, AITA for disagreeing with our HR?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app? | Found out my girlfriend reinstalled tinder at her best friends bachelorette party 3ish months ago and hid it from me. She still had the app on her phone,  and would browse it. Had an updated picture and profile and blocked my account. Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way. Was suprised to get off work and see so many comments and votes. Really does help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my child about his dad? | I was with Michael for 8 months, after breaking up I found out I was pregnant.\n\nMichael was around every day for those 9 months \n\nWhen our son was born Michael paid child support, he always paid extra.\n\nMichael was around for the first 3 years until I met my husband.\n\nWe both agreed it would be better for our son to have a normal family.\n\nMichael was studying to get his doctorate at that time.\n\nLast I heard Michael had gotten married and has two daughters.\n\n\n\nMichael paid  support up until 4 years ago.\n\nMy son is now 24.\n\nWe recently made the choice to tell him about Michael.\n\nHe hasn't spoken to us since.\n\nETA; Michael isn't around anymore, he passed away about 3 years ago, idk how \n\n\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church? | My family is all Catholic and I'm from an almost all Irish family. Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"I backed the van filled with people into the parking spot.\"\"\"",
        "model_response": "\"**WIBTA if I snitch to my boss, that my nice coworker isn\u2019t doing her job?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**. It's understandable to feel frustrated when a coworker is not meeting their responsibilities, especially when it affects your own work. You have tried to address the issue directly with her, and it seems that the situation is not improving. Reporting the issue to your boss may be necessary to protect your own reputation and work quality.\n\n\"**AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**. While it's important to teach beginners, using aggressive sparring tactics to \"put them in their place\" is not an effective or respectful way to handle the situation. It's better to provide constructive feedback and guidance rather than resorting to humiliation.\n\n\"**AITA for disagreeing with our HR?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**. It's reasonable to voice your concerns about HR's handling of ID cards and office discipline. If you feel that HR is not meeting their responsibilities, it's appropriate to express your dissatisfaction.\n\n\"**AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**. Trust is fundamental in a relationship, and your feelings about her using a dating app in secret are valid. It's important to communicate your boundaries and expectations in a relationship.\n\n\"**AITA for not telling my child about his dad?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**. It's important to be honest with your child about their parentage, even if the situation is complicated. Keeping this information from them can lead to feelings of betrayal and confusion.\n\n\"**AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**. It's important to allow your daughter to explore her beliefs and friendships. Forbidding her from attending another church may create resentment and conflict.\n\n\"**AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**. You were not obligated to disclose your living situation, especially since you have been performing your job well. The mother's reaction seems unreasonable.\n\n\"**AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**. It's not appropriate to shame someone for trying to help another customer. If you had a bad experience, it's better to address it calmly rather than resorting to insults.\n\n\"**I backed the van filled with people into the parking spot.**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**. It's important to be cautious and aware of your surroundings when driving, especially with passengers in the vehicle.",

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I\u2019m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me. I\u2019m thinking about just telling the director EVERYTHING and have her be his problem. \n\n\nWIBTA\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s her day off today and I\u2019m looking through her files to see if she put my name on any.

We didn't like the idea of a traditional baby shower, so we decided to have a baby \"party\", and we invited everyone with whom we still had some semblance of a relationship.\n\nWe learned that my parents had told anyone invited to the party that they had to choose \u2013 my parents or us. They were serious, apparently, because the ones who came to the party have not heard from them since.\n\nGiven that my parents hadn't spoken to me in over a year and that they had gone to pretty extraordinary lengths to ostracize my wife and me from my extended family, I had no reason to believe they had interest in my life any longer, so I saw no reason to tell them about the birth of our daughter.\n\nI received an email a couple days after my daughter was born, in which my mom expressed her \"disappointment\" that I hadn't told her. I replied by explaining why, and I told her that our relationship could be salvaged, but a prerequisite was her acknowledging the hurtful things she had done in the previous two years. I also noted that I couldn't guarantee that the relationship could be salvaged, but an honest apology would be a good first step. I didn't hear back from her.\n\nLast year, I received a similar email, and I provided a similar response; this time, my mom told me my grandmother was in a nursing home, but she refused to tell me where. We asked my godmother \u2013 mom\u2019s sister \u2013 who called us disgusting and cruel for what we had done, though she didn\u2019t tell us what that was.\n\nMy best guess here is that my parents find that our decision not to tell them we had a baby was cruel, which leads to my question here. I have been generally confident, but sometimes I really wonder whether I'm missing something and that it's actually my fault...\n\nAITA for this?",

Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office.

Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed.

They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area.

Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week. So, AITA for disagreeing with our HR?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app? | Found out my girlfriend reinstalled tinder at her best friends bachelorette party 3ish months ago and hid it from me. She still had the app on her phone,  and would browse it. Had an updated picture and profile and blocked my account. Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way. Was suprised to get off work and see so many comments and votes.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane.

She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus.

He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area.

Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part.

She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house.

No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane.

Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I\u2019m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week. So, AITA for disagreeing with our HR?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app? | Found out my girlfriend reinstalled tinder at her best friends bachelorette party 3ish months ago and hid it from me.

This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part.

She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well).

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks.

Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for texting a stranger? | I was on the website of a pastor I enjoy listening to.

One of them, we'll call her \"Betty\" had commented praising the pastor for his post, mentioned that they had met when he preached at her church and she felt like they had a connection and she wanted to speak to him and reconnect. Betty's profile picture and the general tone of her comment gave me the idea that she might be elderly. Based on her photo, she seemed like she was at least 70/75.

Just last week I saw three, \"lost my cellphone, got a new one, let me know your number!\" posts and in the comments were several phone numbers. These are all pages with no privacy settings, anyone can see them.\n\nAnyway, I noticed a lot of trolls in the comments on the pastor's page saying some pretty awful things, commenting mean things to other commenters and I got a little worried that one of them might send \"Betty\" some nasty texts. I've been doxxed before and had some truly terrible things sent to my phone that resulted in me having to get a new number. I didn't want to see a little old lady get messed with so I sent her a text, \"hey Betty, my name is u/Apprehensive-Sorbet, I saw your number on Pastor X's blog.

Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego.

She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus.

During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego.

Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego.

They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way.

Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house.

No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well).

This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way.

Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid.

        "model_response": "\"**WIBTA if I snitch to my boss, that my nice coworker isn\u2019t doing her job?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**  \nReason: The coworker's lack of performance is affecting your work and the team's overall productivity. You've tried to address the issue directly with her, and it seems that the situation is not improving. Reporting the issue to your boss is a reasonable step to take.\n\n\"**AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**  \nReason: While it's understandable to be frustrated with inexperienced practitioners, your approach of going hard in sparring is not conducive to a positive learning environment. It's important to foster a supportive atmosphere for beginners rather than trying to embarrass them.\n\n\"**AITA for disagreeing with our HR?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**  \nReason: It's reasonable to voice your concerns about HR's handling of ID cards and office discipline. You and your colleagues are justified in wanting to address the shortcomings of HR rather than accepting them without question.\n\n\"**AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**  \nReason: Trust is a fundamental aspect of any relationship, and your concerns about her using a dating app while in a relationship are valid. It's important to communicate your feelings and set boundaries.\n\n\"**AITA for not telling my child about his dad?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**  \nReason: While you may have had your reasons for not disclosing information about the child's father, it's important to be honest with your child about their background. Keeping secrets can lead to feelings of betrayal and confusion.\n\n\"**AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**  \nReason: It's important to allow your daughter to explore her beliefs and friendships. Forbidding her from attending another church may create resentment and hinder her personal growth.\n\n\"**AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**  \nReason: You were not obligated to disclose your living situation, especially since you have been performing your job well. The mother's reaction seems unreasonable.\n\n\"**AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**  \nReason: It's not appropriate to shame someone for trying to assist another customer. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's important to approach situations with understanding rather than anger.\n\n\"**I carefully stepped on every frog on my way to work.**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**  \nReason: This seems to be a humorous or light-hearted expression of frustration.

Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week. So, AITA for disagreeing with our HR?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app? | Found out my girlfriend reinstalled tinder at her best friends bachelorette party 3ish months ago and hid it from me.

My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way.

Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"I gave her the best directions\"\"\"",
        "model_response": "\"**AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**  \nReason: Trust is a fundamental aspect of any relationship, and your feelings are valid. It's understandable to be upset when you discover your partner is using a dating app while in a relationship with you. You communicated your concerns and set boundaries, which is important in a healthy relationship.\n\n\"**AITA for not telling my child about his dad?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**  \nReason: You made a decision based on what you believed was best for your son at the time. It's a difficult situation, and while your son may be upset, it's important to have open communication moving forward.\n\n\"**AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**  \nReason: As a parent, you have the right to guide your child's religious upbringing. However, it's also important to have open discussions with your daughter about her beliefs and choices.\n\n\"**AITA for not telling my boss I live near the 'projects'?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**  \nReason: You did not feel it was necessary to disclose your living situation, especially since it does not affect your work. The mother's reaction seems to stem from her own insecurities rather than a reflection of your character.\n\n\"**AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**  \nReason: While you were frustrated with the service, it's important to remember that cashiers are human and can make mistakes. Instead of shaming them, it would have been more constructive to express your concerns calmly.\n\n\"**I gave her the best directions**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**  \nReason: You provided assistance and guidance, which is commendable. It's important to help others when they are lost or confused.",

Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left.

I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well).

He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid.

We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I\u2019m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me. I\u2019m thinking about just telling the director EVERYTHING and have her be his problem. \n\n\nWIBTA\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s her day off today and I\u2019m looking through her files to see if she put my name on any. Well her deadline is tomorrow and has gotten barely anything done. She just has a sketch and yes she put my name on it. So instead of finishing my work that\u2019s due Friday, I have to rush to do hers. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m guaranteed to get in trouble.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are? | I do Jiu Jitsu, have been for the past 5 years. For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation.

        "test_prompt": "\"\"\"WIBTA if I snitch to my boss, that my nice coworker isn\u2019t doing her job? | My job recently hired a new girl. We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I\u2019m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me. I\u2019m thinking about just telling the director EVERYTHING and have her be his problem. \n\n\nWIBTA\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s her day off today and I\u2019m looking through her files to see if she put my name on any. Well her deadline is tomorrow and has gotten barely anything done. She just has a sketch and yes she put my name on it. So instead of finishing my work that\u2019s due Friday, I have to rush to do hers. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m guaranteed to get in trouble.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are? | I do Jiu Jitsu, have been for the past 5 years. For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week. So, AITA for disagreeing with our HR?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app? | Found out my girlfriend reinstalled tinder at her best friends bachelorette party 3ish months ago and hid it from me. She still had the app on her phone,  and would browse it. Had an updated picture and profile and blocked my account. Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way. Was suprised to get off work and see so many comments and votes. Really does help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my child about his dad? | I was with Michael for 8 months, after breaking up I found out I was pregnant.\n\nMichael was around every day for those 9 months \n\nWhen our son was born Michael paid child support, he always paid extra.\n\nMichael was around for the first 3 years until I met my husband.\n\nWe both agreed it would be better for our son to have a normal family.\n\nMichael was studying to get his doctorate at that time.\n\nLast I heard Michael had gotten married and has two daughters.\n\n\n\nMichael paid  support up until 4 years ago.\n\nMy son is now 24.\n\nWe recently made the choice to tell him about Michael.\n\nHe hasn't spoken to us since.\n\nETA; Michael isn't around anymore, he passed away about 3 years ago, idk how \n\n\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church? | My family is all Catholic and I'm from an almost all Irish family. Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for telling these girls that eating fake meat is no better than real meat for the environment | Posting on a friends account for anonymity but anyways this is my first post so I\u2019m sorry for any formatting issues. \n\nSo I (20M) live in the apartment next to these two girls (19F) and we all attend the same college.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

It's understandable to feel frustrated when a coworker is not meeting their responsibilities, especially when it affects your own work. You have tried to address the issue directly with her and have been put in a difficult position by your supervisor. Reporting the situation to your boss is a reasonable course of action.\n\n\"**AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**. While it's important to teach beginners, using aggressive sparring tactics to \"put them in their place\" is not an effective or respectful way to handle the situation. It's better to provide constructive feedback and guidance rather than resorting to humiliation.\n\n\"**AITA for disagreeing with our HR?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**. It's reasonable to voice your concerns about HR's handling of ID cards and office discipline. You and your colleagues are justified in wanting to address the shortcomings of HR, especially when it affects your work environment.\n\n\"**AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and your feelings about her using a dating app in secret are valid. It's important to communicate your boundaries and expectations in a relationship.\n\n\"**AITA for not telling my child about his dad?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**. While you may have had your reasons for not disclosing this information, it's important to be honest with your child about their parentage, especially as they grow older.\n\n\"**AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**. It's important to respect your daughter's choices and allow her to explore her beliefs. Forbidding her from attending another church may create resentment and conflict.\n\n\"**AITA for not telling my boss I live near the 'projects'?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**. You were not obligated to disclose your living situation, especially since it does not affect your ability to perform your job. The mother's reaction seems unreasonable.\n\n\"**AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**. It's not appropriate to shame someone for trying to assist another customer, even if it inconveniences you. Everyone deserves respect in their job.\n\n\"**When my son told me he was gay, I rejected him.**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**. Rejecting your child for their sexual orientation is not acceptable. It's important to support and love your child unconditionally.",

Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not forgiving my wife straight away after an argument? | Complex issue, but simply she has anger issues, loses control and packs bags to leave, nothing will help in calming her down, I need to rise above the high emotions to keep things together, and then there is the conciliation. This has happened dozens of times over the years.\n\nI'm not blameless and admit my shortcomings and apologise. She does so after making lots of damaging comments. She ended up finally seeking help and was prescribed some meds. These were surprisingly effective and this was great. More calm, considered, and controlled. All of a sudden small things were a 5 minute chat rather than a balls-out fight. Promises were made, new leafs turned, etc.\n\nShe then forgot to take them, lost control of her emotions, and there was another argument about a minor difference in opinion that resulted in a 2 day fight. We spoke about the meds in the wash-up and the need to not forget taking them. Well it happened, again, after she *forgot to take them for a week*.\n\nSo now she's ready to make things better after 2 days of being very nasty, knowing the effect it has on me, knowing the importance and effectiveness of her meds, and knowing the repercussions of all of this. I'm cold about it all and am not ready to resume normal relations. I've made the decision to be on the couch for the foreseeable future. I'm ambivalent about all of this now. It's not hard to take a tablet. Sure, you can forget a day but not a week. You can do it once, but not twice.

We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I\u2019m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me. I\u2019m thinking about just telling the director EVERYTHING and have her be his problem. \n\n\nWIBTA\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s her day off today and I\u2019m looking through her files to see if she put my name on any. Well her deadline is tomorrow and has gotten barely anything done. She just has a sketch and yes she put my name on it. So instead of finishing my work that\u2019s due Friday, I have to rush to do hers. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m guaranteed to get in trouble.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are? | I do Jiu Jitsu, have been for the past 5 years. For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed.

Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out.

He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude.

We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I\u2019m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me. I\u2019m thinking about just telling the director EVERYTHING and have her be his problem. \n\n\nWIBTA\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s her day off today and I\u2019m looking through her files to see if she put my name on any. Well her deadline is tomorrow and has gotten barely anything done. She just has a sketch and yes she put my name on it. So instead of finishing my work that\u2019s due Friday, I have to rush to do hers. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m guaranteed to get in trouble.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are? | I do Jiu Jitsu, have been for the past 5 years. For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week. So, AITA for disagreeing with our HR?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app? | Found out my girlfriend reinstalled tinder at her best friends bachelorette party 3ish months ago and hid it from me. She still had the app on her phone,  and would browse it. Had an updated picture and profile and blocked my account. Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way. Was suprised to get off work and see so many comments and votes. Really does help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my child about his dad? | I was with Michael for 8 months, after breaking up I found out I was pregnant.\n\nMichael was around every day for those 9 months \n\nWhen our son was born Michael paid child support, he always paid extra.\n\nMichael was around for the first 3 years until I met my husband.\n\nWe both agreed it would be better for our son to have a normal family.\n\nMichael was studying to get his doctorate at that time.\n\nLast I heard Michael had gotten married and has two daughters.\n\n\n\nMichael paid  support up until 4 years ago.\n\nMy son is now 24.\n\nWe recently made the choice to tell him about Michael.\n\nHe hasn't spoken to us since.\n\nETA; Michael isn't around anymore, he passed away about 3 years ago, idk how \n\n\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church? | My family is all Catholic and I'm from an almost all Irish family. Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not helping a sick person on a flight I took (I am a 4th year med student) | Throwaway because my friends know my account\n\nContext: I am a 4th year medical student with experience in hospitals, GP surgeries and care homes. \n\nRecently, I was on a flight back from a holiday I took to Mexico back to the UK where I live.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well).

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week. So, AITA for disagreeing with our HR?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app? | Found out my girlfriend reinstalled tinder at her best friends bachelorette party 3ish months ago and hid it from me. She still had the app on her phone,  and would browse it. Had an updated picture and profile and blocked my account. Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way.

Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night.

He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week. So, AITA for disagreeing with our HR?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app? | Found out my girlfriend reinstalled tinder at her best friends bachelorette party 3ish months ago and hid it from me. She still had the app on her phone,  and would browse it. Had an updated picture and profile and blocked my account. Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way.

Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid.

We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher.

So instead of finishing my work that\u2019s due Friday, I have to rush to do hers.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week. So, AITA for disagreeing with our HR?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app? | Found out my girlfriend reinstalled tinder at her best friends bachelorette party 3ish months ago and hid it from me.

Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template.

One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent.

Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. \n\nThe problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn\u2019t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we\u2019re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn\u2019t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I\u2019ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don\u2019t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it\u2019s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn\u2019t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. \n\nFor awhile now she\u2019s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it\u2019s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. \n\nHe gave a lecture about the ink isn\u2019t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically \u201cBlitznyx would\u2019ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.\u201d. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I\u2019m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me. I\u2019m thinking about just telling the director EVERYTHING and have her be his problem. \n\n\nWIBTA\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s her day off today and I\u2019m looking through her files to see if she put my name on any. Well her deadline is tomorrow and has gotten barely anything done. She just has a sketch and yes she put my name on it. So instead of finishing my work that\u2019s due Friday, I have to rush to do hers. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m guaranteed to get in trouble.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for going hard in sparring against beginners who think they're better than they are? | I do Jiu Jitsu, have been for the past 5 years. For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week. So, AITA for disagreeing with our HR?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app? | Found out my girlfriend reinstalled tinder at her best friends bachelorette party 3ish months ago and hid it from me. She still had the app on her phone,  and would browse it. Had an updated picture and profile and blocked my account. Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way. Was suprised to get off work and see so many comments and votes. Really does help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my child about his dad? | I was with Michael for 8 months, after breaking up I found out I was pregnant.\n\nMichael was around every day for those 9 months \n\nWhen our son was born Michael paid child support, he always paid extra.\n\nMichael was around for the first 3 years until I met my husband.\n\nWe both agreed it would be better for our son to have a normal family.\n\nMichael was studying to get his doctorate at that time.\n\nLast I heard Michael had gotten married and has two daughters.\n\n\n\nMichael paid  support up until 4 years ago.\n\nMy son is now 24.\n\nWe recently made the choice to tell him about Michael.\n\nHe hasn't spoken to us since.\n\nETA; Michael isn't around anymore, he passed away about 3 years ago, idk how \n\n\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church? | My family is all Catholic and I'm from an almost all Irish family. Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for refusing to lend money? | Hi guys, thanks for reading\nSo back in December I had a couple of family members reach out and want to \"reconnect\". One of the two, my Aunt, I've not seen since 1998 when she and my mother fell out. My cousin, her daughter, I've not seen since 2007 when it transpired she was at the same school I was at and very quickly moved to London with her mother and my uncle (my mother and aunts half brother).\n\nSo all had been well, up until last week. My cousin called me in tears saying oh she can't afford essentials for her two children (I knew she had a child but didn't know about 2), diapers and milk and stuff, could I please send her about a tenner (\u00a310) that she would give back to me in the morning.\n\nBeing the sucker I am, 8 said to her yes okay you can have that, because I won't ever see a child go without. But, half an hour later my aunt called me and asked could give them an extra twenty or thirty pounds for food. She sent me a picture of the bank account she wanted it to go to, which was for my uncle mentioned above, who is known in my local area for being a habitual drunk and drug user. \n\nI said no to my aunt's request guys because I'd literally spent money in my wedding dress that week, and my dog got rushed to the vets as an emergency (which cost me, my partner, and his parents almost a thousand between us) so I had no money at all. The ten pounds I sent for the diapers was stretching it a bit, literally like scraping the pot for that. I apologises and said I'm sorry, but no I've not seen you for 22 years and I simply cannot afford it. My aunt said \"I guess you don't care about us then\" and out the phone down.\n\nYesterday and today they've both messaged me asking if can lend them another tenner for food, cigarettes, and nappies again. I've said no again because I a) cannot afford it and b) I'm not comfortable lending money to people I barely know.

My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all.

I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way. Was suprised to get off work and see so many comments and votes. Really does help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my child about his dad? | I was with Michael for 8 months, after breaking up I found out I was pregnant.\n\nMichael was around every day for those 9 months \n\nWhen our son was born Michael paid child support, he always paid extra.\n\nMichael was around for the first 3 years until I met my husband.\n\nWe both agreed it would be better for our son to have a normal family.\n\nMichael was studying to get his doctorate at that time.\n\nLast I heard Michael had gotten married and has two daughters.\n\n\n\nMichael paid  support up until 4 years ago.\n\nMy son is now 24.\n\nWe recently made the choice to tell him about Michael.\n\nHe hasn't spoken to us since.\n\nETA; Michael isn't around anymore, he passed away about 3 years ago, idk how \n\n\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church? | My family is all Catholic and I'm from an almost all Irish family. Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for explaining how I watered some plants | I used to work in the garden center of a popular retail store, and one particular day I was given the task of watering orchids.

For those unfamiliar it's a grappling martial art, lots of armlocks, chokeholds, leglocks etc. It has a belt system, like most other arts White is the first belt you're on. Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well).

It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego.

It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury. I'm not dumping people on their necks headfirst, grabbing their leg and cranking it until it I hear their knee rip apart ...chill.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for disagreeing with our HR? | I am a 7 month newly hired employee for a big corporation. Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area.

He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane.

It's important to maintain a professional work environment, and if a coworker is not meeting their responsibilities, it can affect the entire team.

It's reasonable to voice concerns about HR's handling of ID cards and office discipline, especially when it affects your ability to work. Open communication is important in a workplace.\n\n\"**AITA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum over an app?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, and it's understandable to be upset about your girlfriend using a dating app in secret. Setting boundaries is important.\n\n\"**AITA for not telling my child about his dad?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**. It's important to be honest with your child about their parentage, even if the situation is complicated. Keeping secrets can lead to trust issues later on.\n\n\"**AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**. It's important to respect your daughter's choices and allow her to explore her beliefs. Forbidding her from attending another church may create resentment.\n\n\"**AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"?**\"  \nVerdict: **Not wrong**. You were not asked about your living situation, and you did not feel it was a safety issue. It's reasonable to expect trust from your employer.\n\n\"**AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer?**\"  \nVerdict: **Wrong**. It's important to be patient and understanding in customer service situations.

Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place.

Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher. It's very physical but after 5 years I know enough to implement my offence without taking someone off the mats with an injury.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

Then blue, purple, brown, black. \n\nI've been at the same gym since I first started, seen heaps of people come and go. One thing that irks me like nothing else are 'White Belts coaches'.. they will go to other white belts and sometimes even more senior belts and confidently try and correct their technique, or show them something they learnt off YouTube before they came to class, most of the time what they're spewing is completely wrong and almost dangerous to an extent. It shits me to no end, I've politely corrected people before but it doesn't really seem to register with them.\n\nWhat I tend to do nowadays is offer to spar with them, and I will go near on 100% and try to submit them as many times as possible in embarassing ways, and usually go to the positions they're trying to show their techniques from and shut them down completely in front of our other classmates. Sounds harsh but the way I see it, people need an ego check now and then, but on the other hand sometimes I think it's probably me with the ego. The way I see it though if you're a white belt you should just stfu, listen and absorb from the coaches. The exception being maybe if you already come from a wrestling, judo, or MMA background.\n\nOn a closing note I'll add that I don't act this way to your regular white belts, I'll just match their intensity when we spar and let them work.\n\nEdit: from the comments people assume I'm maiming and permanently injuring people, sending people home with broken bones and leaving a trail of bodies on the mat. That's my fault for not clarifying in the OP. I'll stress that this is very much aggressive, but controlled aggression, when I say 100% I mean I would use the same amount of aggression I would against someone of my own rank or higher.

Last night our HR sent out a five page memo to all employees titled \"Office Discipline\". Basically, they were reminding everyone of the various rules around the office. Like not loitering during office hours, sticking to our lunch schedules, the correct dress code, wearing of IDs at all times etc. In my 6 month stay here our HR hasn't issued me an office ID card. Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us. Everyone without an office ID just started using government issued IDs to be able to enter our building but this morning, security started telling everyone that starting next week anyone without an ID will have their names be noted and be reported to HR. I promptly called HR when I got to my desk to ask for a status for my (and my other colleagues) ID. They told me that they can't print our IDs yet because the team in charge is swarmed with other \"projects\" and suggested that we can print our own IDs, and gave us the template. My colleagues and I disagreed with this. We argued that we don't want to make up for the short comings of HR, by shelling out money from our own pockets to print our IDs, and that it should have been provided to us in the first place. We plan on just keep using whatever IDs we have right now be damned whatever happens next week.

My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time.

Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not inviting a section of my family to Christmas dinner? | It's our turn to host Christmas dinner this year, but we haven't invited my husband's sister and her family because of disagreements. \n\nA few months ago, Natalie (sister) invited everyone except my daughter Evie to her daughter Lucy's 10th birthday party.

She's a very pretty girl, has lots of friends and is top of her class, and has never been in any serious trouble at school, so I strongly doubt she's a bully. In all honesty, everything is called bullying nowadays. Evie is called a bully because she might have made a few mean jokes about Lucy over many years. It's never been any more serious than that and I would deal with it immediately if it was. Maybe Nat should teach\nher daughter that she won't get anywhere in the world by crying when things don't go her way. She'll be a teenager soon too, and it's a tough world.\n\nEvie wasn't bothered about not being invited to a 10 year olds party, but I thought it was offensive to exclude every single child *except her*. That in itself is humiliating, especially as I don't doubt Nat will have happily told everyone why Evie wasn't invited. \n\nIn response, I decided not to invite them to Christmas dinner. My husband was absolutely fuming when I told him this, but when I said my reasons - that people who went out of their way to exclude/humiliate our child aren't welcome in our home - he now agrees, but his mother and brother have been calling us non-stop, saying it would be cruel to exclude them from the family Christmas traditions.

Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for taking my coworker down a notch ? | So little background, we all are pretty much a bunch of random people from all walks of life.

I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well).

She still had the app on her phone,  and would browse it. Had an updated picture and profile and blocked my account. Nothing suggestive.\n\nTold her straight I won't continue seeing her unless she gets rid of the account and app. She did and understand my point of view, although after accusing me of trust issues.\n\nHer bestfriend messages me to reassure me she never cheated and it was my problem. I simply didn't understand their asian culture[im western living with an asian gf in asia] and She would be fine if her husband used tinder etc. I told her thats fine but I am not comfortable with my girlfriend browsing dating apps in secret. \n\nHer best friend since then told my gf that she doesnt like me and she doesn't want me around her or her husband again. My gf is now conflicted because her best friend from childhood is basically cutting me and indirectly her off from them. \n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nCan explain in more details as needed without doxing myself.\n\nINFO- i found out because my girlfriend kept hiding her phone from me when I walked by. This was a new behavior since the party. It kept bothering me in my mind, so I reinstalled [i had not deleted my account just the app which is 100% inactive since dating her] tinder and found her account gone. Told myself she must have deleted it and so removed the app and my account this time. But I was still getting red flags and recreated an account and lowered the distance and narrowed age and found her account quickly. I was pretty destroyed. She admitted it to having it after I told her that.\n\nUpdate: I am trying to speak further with her about it and hopefully we can work it out because I do care about her; but will be careful moving forward. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave support and let me know I am not crazy for feeling this way. Was suprised to get off work and see so many comments and votes. Really does help.\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my child about his dad? | I was with Michael for 8 months, after breaking up I found out I was pregnant.\n\nMichael was around every day for those 9 months \n\nWhen our son was born Michael paid child support, he always paid extra.\n\nMichael was around for the first 3 years until I met my husband.\n\nWe both agreed it would be better for our son to have a normal family.\n\nMichael was studying to get his doctorate at that time.\n\nLast I heard Michael had gotten married and has two daughters.\n\n\n\nMichael paid  support up until 4 years ago.\n\nMy son is now 24.\n\nWe recently made the choice to tell him about Michael.\n\nHe hasn't spoken to us since.\n\nETA; Michael isn't around anymore, he passed away about 3 years ago, idk how \n\n\n\nAITA?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not letting my daughter attend her friend's church? | My family is all Catholic and I'm from an almost all Irish family. Basically everyone in the extended tree on both sides is Catholic, though many non-practicing. We're not very practicing either honestly, probably attend Mass around once a month besides special events and holidays, but we're still very Catholic if you know what I mean.\n\nMy daughter was confirmed about a year ago. I told her we wouldn't force her to attend Mass anymore after that and she basically quit going. A few months ago she became close to a Protestant friend and going to her youth group with her. Later she started asking if she could go to church Sunday evenings with the friend. I told her no, she's not going to a non-Catholic church. She told me I'm no longer requiring her to go to Mass so there should be no point, I said that doesn't mean she's allowed to attend other churches. Her choices are go to Mass or not attend at all. I also later forbid her from going to youth group and gave the same choice: Catholic youth group or none.\n\nMy husband thinks I'm being unnecessarily rigid. Am I?\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not telling my boss I live near the \"projects\"? | I currently live next to an apartment complex for people on rental assistance. I am not on RA, but the rent is cheaper and it\u2019s not in the best area. I work as a nanny 20 minutes away in a different town and you would think it was a totally different county because of how much nicer it is. Pretty much everyone there has a nanny, everyone is wealthy, mostly private schools, etc. Now, the city I live in isn\u2019t all poor, it\u2019s pretty diverse in terms of income, I just happen to live in the poorer part. And when I got the job, my boss didn\u2019t inquire where I lived specifically. I always went to their house to work and even when I picked up the two older kids, I brought them directly home.\n\nLast week, however, the mother was having some of her friends over because one of the women is moving abroad. She asked if I would mind having the kids over to my house. My home isn\u2019t in an unsafe area, it\u2019s just not the best in comparison to hers. Even so, I didn\u2019t think of it as an issue. When the time came, I packed up some toys for the kids and brought the youngest with me to pick up her brothers and we went to my house. We played at the park nearby before going back to my place to watch some movies and play. The dad came by to pick them up, thanked me and left. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nThe next day, the mom reprimanded me for not telling her exactly where I lived and asked why I thought \u201cthe projects\u201d (as she called them) were a safe place for her kids and why I didn\u2019t tell her. I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t think it was a huge deal and she never asked. Plus when I gave her my address, she could\u2019ve figured it out as the street is well known for the area. She told me that she was probably being too protective but next time she would have me bring them elsewhere (like her mother\u2019s, which I\u2019ve done in the past as I know her mom well). The dad later said not to worry about it, he only told the wife because about 10 years ago (way before I moved in) there was a shooting in the area. (I didn\u2019t know that.)\n\nAITA for not telling them where I lived?\"\"\"\nVerdict: not wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for shaming a cashier for helping another customer? | I went grocery shopping last night. I got the same cashier who forgot to put an entire bag of groceries of mine last week. I was annoyed, but let it go. I didn't have much this time, just a three items. He scanned one item and the cashier next to him said he got locked out in the middle of a transaction. The person he was checking had a shitload of groceries. My cashier stopped to help him out and took 10x longer to fix the problem than it would have to have checked me out. He kept me waiting. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked why he couldn't have just finished checking me out before dealing with the drama in the other lane. He mentioned that it didn't take long and I corrected him that it took TOO long and unlike him, I'm not being paid. Then I mentioned how he forgot an entire bag of groceries last week and the problem is him and to get it right.\n\nANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDDDD yes, I worked at a grocery store during college too.\"\"\"\nVerdict: wrong\n\n\"\"\"AITA for not thanking my brother-in-law for buying me dinner after we had an argument? | 21F, BIL is 30. I\u2019ve had issues with him for a long time: classic immaturity, narcissism, likes to intentionally provoke me.\n\nTonight, he noticed the rubbish bin oveflowing onto the road. \n\nHe says, \u201cThere\u2019s rubbish all over the road because SOMEONE doesn\u2019t know how to put the rubbish in the bin properly\u201d. \n\nIt was my fault, but I\u2019m annoyed that he seriously can\u2019t come in and say, \u201cThere\u2019s rubbish on the road because you didn\u2019t put the rubbish in properly. Can you clean it up?\u201d \n\nI retort, and that\u2019s that. We move to another room with my sister, I\u2019m a little moody at this point. I knew he would keep prodding, as he usually does.\n\nHe spends the next 10 minutes giggling, \u201cWhy is it in a mood? What did I do? What\u2019s its problem?\u201d\nYes, he refers to me as \u201cit\u201d. This annoys me even more. He pokes and pokes. I don\u2019t respond. He leaves the room, my sister asks what\u2019s wrong. I tell her I\u2019m annoyed with how he acted. He comes back in, she tells him, he goes on to make more jokes about it. Giggling, he picks up his toddler son and says things like, \u201cYour aunty doesn\u2019t know how to put rubbish in the bin, does she?\u201d\n\nHe repeats this multiple times and can\u2019t seem to drop it. Sister is defending me at this point, telling him he\u2019s being a dick, needs to stop etc. At some point, he walks to the kitchen and drinks Coke straight out of the bottle (which he knows pisses me off). I retreat to my bedroom to nap (prompting a \u201cwhere\u2019s it going?\u201d from him). \n\nI\u2019m woken up by my sister who tells me that BIL bought me a pizza for dinner. This seriously fucking shits me. He can\u2019t bring up the bin situation maturely, and now he can\u2019t apologise for it either. He\u2019s not the type of guy who admits when he\u2019s wrong, so the pizza felt more like a twisting of the knife than an apology. \n\nI don\u2019t touch the pizza on account of me being stubborn. Sister tells me I should say thanks. I tell her I\u2019m not hungry. She tells me I should still say thanks and that I\u2019m being rude. I explain to her that I\u2019m still pissed, she tells me I need to take a joke and that I\u2019m being sensitive. It\u2019s funny how she was defending me at the time but has now done a complete 180. I\u2019m the bad guy now. \n\nAfter a few more back and forths, she tells me it\u2019s his way of apologising and that I should thank him. This just makes me angrier. I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s suddenly enabling him again. What happened to actual, adult apologies? I know that he doesn\u2019t feel bad for his actions. I didn\u2019t want to accept this pizza, so I didn\u2019t say thank-you. I wanted an apology, not a pizza. I said to my sister, if he wants a thank-you he can come here and apologise first. \n\nTL;DR: My BIL provokes me, I\u2019m visibly upset. He buys me a pizza, I was still mad and refused to accept it. He never actually apologised, so I never thanked him for the pizza. I didn\u2019t eat it. \n\nThis caused a rift in the household tonight so I\u2019m curious: am I the asshole?\"\"\"",
